# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Review-and-Rating

In this project,we explore various natural language processing(NLP)
methods to perform sentiment analysis on the dataset Sentiment
Scale Dataset collected by Cornell University for train and test. The
goal of this project is to predict the sentiments of reviews by using
multi task method and compare the results. As the reviews are
classified into five categories, which are very negative, negative,
neutral, positive and very positive, We use multi-task learning
technique to learn different features in different tasks to improve
the performance of multi-label classification. In the experiment,
we compare the performance of three models, one is single task
model that only considers the words in a review document, the
other two models are multi-task process that learn words sequence
and corresponding tag, words sequence and rating of the review.
The results show that the multi-task models outperform the single
task model.
