"so what would cause 2 grown women and about 2 dozen grown men to faint ? lest you faint , let me tell you up-front that the same jackie chan plays them both . jackie chan films are endurable and enjoyable only because of the boyish charm and energetic bravado of chan himself . the scripts for his movies are usually so thin that , without jackie chan , it would be almost ridiculous to contemplate going to see them . twin dragons , originally released in 1992 , has just been re-released theatrically without allowing the film to be screened in advance to film critics . this is probably smart marketing since , among the jackie chan films , this one is probably one of the silliest and lamest . if you have not seen his movies before , you might be inclined to shake your head and walk out during the first 10 minutes of this one , as it's quite ludicrous . leaving would be a mistake , although going in the first place is still questionable . once you're there , stick around because jackie , especially in the film's grand finale , gets to perform one amazing martial arts feat after another . the whole movie is little more than a ruse for jackie to show us his martial arts skills in a comedic setting . in this broad parody , boomer fights not 1 , not 2 , not 3 but 20 men at a time and eventually wins just before he seems certain to be beaten completely to a pulp . although his later films are much better , this one does have its moments . the plot , such as it is , concerns the misadventures of mr . ma in hong kong as he is mistaken for boomer , and vice versa . when one sneezes , so does the other . the movie is way over-the-top slapstick , but for jackie's die-hard fans , no movie of his can be too hokey . for most of us , we'd be better off renting one of his later , more polished movies and passing on this re-release . it is rated pg-13 for comedic violence , sexual situations and profanity and would be fine for kids 10 or 11 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , found the film confusing , and , although he liked the martial arts , he gave the movie only * 1/2 . his friend steven , age 10 , thought there was a little too much fighting , but liked the comedy enough to give the movie * * 1/2 . his twin , john , thought the movie was really good and worth * * * 1/2 . their friend alan , almost 10 , thought the movie was awesome and was a * * * * motion picture .",0.5
"nevertheless , what separates this film from the many other crime-gone-wrong pictures is that it's almost completely non-violent . there are no shoot outs , fistfights , or explosions . there is a gun , but it's used primarily as a prop . palookaville ( the title is from the classic marlon brando line in on the waterfront about losers ) is the debut feature for director alan taylor , who has used the stories of post-wwii italian author italo calvino and the 1956 comic heist movie , big deal on madonna street , as inspirations . as jerry says , "" we're not really cut out for this . some people are . palookaville opens with a jewelry store robbery gone bad -- but not in reservoir dogs fashion . it's not a very good plan -- parts are culled from the old rko movie , armored car robbery -- but they seem to think it's foolproof . one of the things that elevates palookaville over the likes of bottle rocket and things to do in denver when you're dead is its character development . although this film is sprinkled with comic moments and its tone is basically lighthearted , it treats its protagonists seriously . sid , russ , and jerry seem like real people -- losers with good hearts who want to commit crimes but lack the requisite toughness and cynicism . gallo's russ would like us to believe that he's a tough hood , but his hard personality is really a front . with an evocative score by rachel portman and cinematography by john thomas , palookaville has a feel that belies its $1 million budget . at times , the movie is funny , touching , and quirky . there are a few isolated scenes that don't work , but , in general , palookaville represents insouciant entertainment bolstered by an unforced message about not taking the "" american dream "" too seriously . after all , the people in palookaville may be losers with little hope of rising above their circumstances , but that doesn't mean they don't have hearts and souls . and , although it may appear tarantino-inspired at a glance , once you get into palookaville , you'll understand that it has a much kinder , gentler story to tell .",0.75
"1993 has been quite a year for films with chinese and chinese-american themes . now comes cannes film festival palme d'or co-winner farewell my concubine , and it becomes clear that everything else was just a warm-up . director chen kaige has fashioned a drama mesmerizing from first frame to last , and does so without getting artsy or obscure . this is a remarkably accessible epic , and the best film of this year in any language . as adults , the two become the most renowned opera stars in beijing , and adopt new stage names . perhaps the most astonishing thing about farewell is that in spite of its scope , it's really a very simple , old-fashioned love triangle which happens to be about a man and a woman both in love with the same man . the three principals are bold and dynamic characters , each of whom never does exactly what is expected . rather , he treats dieyi more or less as nothing but a co-worker , a man whom he likes and even needs for his career , but doesn't really respect . then there is juxian , perhaps the strongest character emotionally , self-assured to a fault in male-dominated china and capable in that confidence of surprising displays of forgiveness . her conflict with dieyi powers farewell's most haunting moments . chen kaige's direction demonstrates a mastery of composition and narrative structure rarely seen . the opening sequence , a reunion between dieyi and xiaolou which frames the flashbacks to come , is a triumph of lighting and texture . chen crafts brilliant cuts , such as a cut from xiaolou's announcement of his engagement to juxian , and his request for dieyi "" to be my best man , "" to a full screen closeup of dieyi , still in his concubine makeup and looking not like a "" best man "" but a rejected woman . every shot is a minor revelation , raising chen to the level of one of modern cinema's true masters . no amount of hyperbole will get some filmgoers to see a 2 1/2 hour story with subtitles about marginalized characters . i can't think of a greater artistic tragedy . farewell my concubine is a thrilling love story , a political epic and an intimate character study rolled into one stunning package . if you've never seen a non-english language film before , find this one . it's just that good .",1
"in the movies , like in real life , it isn't enough just to have a heart in the right place . good intentions are nice , but they need to be backed up by an intelligent script telling an involving story . in the case of dangerous minds , we get an idealized version of inner city life , where , though problems may require more than the wave of a magic wand to remove , the solutions still seem too facile . with master crowd-pleasers don smith and jerry bruckheimer behind the production , there is never any question that this movie will pander to the least common denominator . drama is pretty much by-the-numbers , tragedy is shallow , and the resolution is expectedly upbeat . emotion and character interaction rarely ring true . a good question , and the answer may explain why this film is so erratic . relationships that should have been better developed are left in an embryonic stage . there's obviously something missing in the way these two learn to relate to each other . the result of this incomplete , hit-and-miss approach diminishes the impact of the film's central tragedy . in the face of hard-hitting pictures like kids and teen dreams , it's difficult not to see this movie as trivializing serious issues . the seams in the script show a little too clearly , and the heavy-handed attempts at audience manipulation stand out . michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance , as do a number of the young actors playing louanne's students , but dangerous minds is in desperate need of more than good acting . it demands substance rather than the filler that the film makers thought would make an acceptable substitute .",0.55
"despite their radically different compositions , both groups have a lot in common . just like abba twenty years ago , the spice girls are pop wonders who manage to rise consistently to the top of the music charts despite the essential vapidity of their hits . now , for better or worse , the spice girls have done something that abba never did : starred in a movie . it's worth noting at the outset that i am definitely not a member of the target audience for this movie . i'm also not a spice girls fan . actually , going into the film , i was rather neutral towards them . they may be pleasant to look at , but their irritating antics as presented here are enough to put someone off of them permanently . suffice it to say that i won't be buying the soundtrack . the movie's premise is as flimsy as can be , but it least it doesn't require a whole lot of acting from the main quintet of baby spice ( emma bunton ) , ginger spice ( geri halliwell ) , scary spice ( melanie brown ) , sporty spice ( melanie chisholm ) , and posh spice ( victoria adams ) . in the end , however , they triumph over all adversity and wow their fans . the press package for spice world makes the jaw-dropping statement that the film is "" a '90s version of a hard day's night with a pinch of this is spinal tap and a dash of speed "" . time for a reality check . any similarities between spice world and those three films are entirely superficial . the speed citation points to a brief parody of a high- speed bus chase , and nothing more . no aspect of spice world's occasional pseudo-documentary approach comes close to the acid edge achieved by spinal tap . and , although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the beatles' classic , it's several long strides behind , lacking the same sense of originality , spontaneity , high energy , and joi de vie . not to mention the differences in music quality . a hard day's night was a breath of fresh air ; spice world is recycled . sadly , however , spiers doesn't generate enough laughter here , and even the "" name the next familiar face "" game can't save the film . although the spice girls , who appear comfortable in front of the camera , are the headliners , there are a few legitimate performers in the film . richard e . grant leads the pack as an intentionally over-the-top neurotic who quickly got on my nerves . alan cumming , barry humphries , george wendt ( as an american movie producer ) , richard o'brien ( best known as riff raff from the rocky horror picture show ) , and claire rushbrook ( as the girls' assistant ) all have more than a few seconds of screen time . spice world is a vanity project -- an ego trip designed to show the five girls in the best possible light and give them a chance to perform about 14 numbers on-screen . as a comedy , it's weak , because most of the jokes are obvious and not especially funny . as a satire , it's weaker , because the screenplay never takes any chances and all of the mini parodies are safe , silly , and creatively lifeless . the film isn't even a particularly good musical , because the songs are so inane . the only people who are likely to be able to sit through spice world without casting numerous yearning glances at the exit are those who number themselves among the group's legion of die-hard fans . ultimately , this film has too much spice and not enough flavoring . - ingmar bergman",0.5
"first , let me clear up a little confusion . there are now two movies in release in the us with almost the same names : fresh and frosh . the movie i saw is a documentary about the lives of a dozen freshmen in a dorm at stanford . clearly , it has the unofficial title of academic freedom today--believe and say anything you want provided it is official politically correct dogma , but more on that latter . in my opinion , documentaries are one of the highest cinematic art forms . they cover a wide spectrum of beliefs from triumph of the will to roger and me . the purpose of a documentary is to allow you to vicariously live in another world , but in the case of a documentary , it is a real world--full of warts , bad grammar , and bad hair days . a documentary , if it is good , will frequently enrage you . at a minimum , it should make you think . three of my absolute favorite movies i have ever seen are documentaries : 28 up , 35 up , and sherman's march . this documentary , although poorly made and constructed , nevertheless , is a full fledged descendent of this art form for it did enrage me , and it certainly made me think . the directing , cinematography , and just about everything in the production of this documentary was done by daniel geller and danya goldfine . as far as the technical merits of the show , it was amateurish in parts . the camera was held fairly steady , but only one camera was used and hence there was too much panning and zooming . the colors were hopelessly faded . they needed a better camera , better processing or something . the editing was a little loose and although scenes had labels , they were pretty arbitrary and overall the documentary was not well organized and constructed . the reason to see this movie has nothing to do with the above technical aspects . you want to see it for the content . in the rest of the review i will cover some of the high points to give you a flavor . based on what was presented in the documentary , the previous statement was a bold face lie . we find kids who almost all think exactly alike , total pc . the parallels with this and the book "" 1984 "" are chilling . what do these kids believe in ? very little . the only consistent value they have seems to be heavy drinking contests , some dope smoking , or lots of hanging around the dorm arguing what is pc and what isn't . i should point out that the term politically correct is never mentioned explicitly in the movie , but the philosophy is all over the place . reading the constitution , especially the bill of rights , does not appear to be part of the curriculum . on the surface the kids seem bonded to each other , but if you think about it for a minute you realize that there are almost no scenes where they do any actions that show they really care for each other . the movie has no mpaa rating . for the drug use and the frequent use of f word , i would assume it would be rated r , but who knows . i would take my teenager to see it and discuss it with him or her about it afterwards . i rate this a must see for anyone with kids anywhere near or at college age . i recommend it to everyone and give it * * * . it runs a bit too long at 1 : 33 . finally , i would love to see a sequel with the same people in their first real job in life . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7
"a strangely intriguing , darkly made psychological allegory based on the late walker hamilton's only novel . it is the directorial debut film of jeremy thomas , the producer of bertolucci , roeg , and cronenberg films , and the husband of the screenwriter eski thomas . the film works its way to a suspenseful but tacky and implausible revenge conclusion , as all its energy seems to have been spent on its fairy tale setup and the relationship between the two kindred spirits . but , nevertheless , this film , if you allowed it to be seen as a proficiently lyrical work , one that is heartfelt and never false , then you can feel the sincerity of it and you can see in the grand shots of bobby's escape to the wilderness , away from civilization , as he earnestly narrates his tale of woe offscreen , how poetical the film is and how it is a modern fairy tale for adults and fans of the cinema that still believe that movies can make them see things again as they did when they were children .",0.7
"nell , jodie foster's return to dramatic acting following a flirtation with maverick's action-comedy , is an entirely human movie . jodie foster's two oscars are no fluke , as her simple-yet-profound performance in nell illustrates . she is one of only a few actors capable of so fully immersing herself in a character that it's possible to forget the star behind the performance . with jack nicholson or al pacino , you watch a variation of the same personality ; with jodie foster , you see a new individual . this , the real meat of nell , is where the film attains its depth and richness . it's a wonderful background for this tale . liam neeson and natasha richardson are solid , but constantly in foster's shadow . in a film as frequently introspective as nell , it's refreshing not to have the three main actors struggling to outdo each other . the gentle , unforced tone , once established , is maintained--until the unfortunate climax . perhaps the writers couldn't think of a better way out of an admittedly-difficult situation , but to pander to the "" hollywood mentality "" of movie endings is a unworthy way to wrap up what is otherwise a finely-crafted motion picture . had the majority of nell not been so impressive , the lackluster final act wouldn't have been as disappointing . despite this moderate tarnish , it is difficult to deny nell's intelligence and sensitivity . we approach this story with the same fascination that nell faces each day , seeing , if only for a short time , how different the world--and people--can be . it is this impression more than any other that stays with the viewer after the drama has been played out and the final credits roll . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore .",0.78
"producers : conchita airoldi , julie taymor and jody patton . director : julie taymor . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 162 minutes . i'm not saying that there's absolutely nothing julie taymor isn't willing to try in her feature film debut titus , but at some point during the production i'm fairly certain i saw a kitchen sink fly through the frame . it came somewhere between the roman soldiers marching in traditional costume and political rivals riding in motorcades , between the swing band playing at an emperor's wedding feast and the swing of a camera around a freeze-frame tableau of death a la the matrix . there's no telling from one minute to the next where or when we are , or what cinematic device will make a cameo appearance . virtually from the first frame , titus unfolds as over two and a half hours of blood , bombast and auteurial audacity . i'm having a hard time putting my finger on exactly why titus actually left me marginally impressed instead of bored by the director's "" hey , check out what i can do "" style . sure , it's shakespeare ; it's also the play t . s . eliot called "" one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written . "" big mistake . without a sense that there's some sort of cultural lesson to be taken away from the gruesome events , they simply become gruesome events . i'd never read titus andronicus nor seen any production before this one , and i can't say i'm terribly eager to see it again . yet while titus is far from a gripping story , it's still a pretty decent piece of theater . taymor's roots are on broadway ( she directed the stage production of the lion king ) , but that doesn't mean she can't make use of a camera . at times , titus almost seems to be the work of a director who isn't sure if she'll ever get the chance to make a film again , so she leaves everything she's got on the screen . it's hard to imagine so grim a tale given more energy through sheer force of a director's imagination . it would be a cruel misuse of the word "" entertaining "" to say that titus qualifies . it's well-acted enough -- cumming in particular is a delight as the foppish saturninus -- but not a showcase for master thespianism . in fact , anthony hopkins' best moment may be a ghoulish reference to his renown as cinema's most famous cannibal . i didn't enjoy all that much of titus , but i found myself admiring taymor's choices even when i didn't understand them , or even agree with them . simply put , titus is a display of film-making nerve -- the spectacle of a novice movie director deciding to pick shakespeare for her first work , and one of shakespeare's least respected works at that , then molding it into something consistently watchable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"although there are shades of close encounters of the third kind , phenomenon is mainly forrest gump-lite . as you can tell , i was extremely disappointed by this show which managed to bore me silly no matter how well intentioned the plot and how earnest the acting . he becomes fluent in portuguese in 20 minutes just by reading a book . mainly he applies it to ways to grow bigger vegetables . now , in the real world , this would certainly be a worthy endeavor as schools from texas a & m to the university of california at davis would attest . as stimulating movie making , it left my entire family bored , fidgeting in our seats , and checking our watches . the script by gerald di pego has lines that includes george's come on to lace of , "" i'd like to get my hands on your carburetor , "" and lace's refusal to george of , "" your idle's too fast .

""" and to all the critics who hated our last flick -- all is forgiven . "" -- chasing amy's closing credits well , i didn't exactly hate mallrats , but i thought it was a comedown for kevin smith , the talented writer/director who debuted strongly with 1994's clerks . chasing amy fits in nicely with the director's previous two films . as in clerks and mallrats , there are numerous references to pop culture ( the ubiquitous star wars films , comic books , the archie comic strip , tv shows alice and star trek , and even a few in-jokes related to clerks ) . smith's brand of bawdy humor is also very much in evidence , although it should be noted that chasing amy isn't as hilarious as clerks . in fact , it could be argued that this film isn't even as funny as mallrats . instead , chasing amy finds other ways to satisfy its audience , and the result is the most complete and mature film of smith's short career . with chasing amy , it's easy to anticipate a certain degree of inventive humor , but what's a bit unexpected is the solid drama , effective romance , and strong characters . clerks worked because the dialogue sparkled , but smith has honed his screenwriting and film making skills since then . while chasing amy boasts the same keen interplay , that quality , along with first-rate character development , acts as a supplement to the smart , surprisingly original plot . the movie starts out as light as a feather , but it doesn't take long for us to realize that chasing amy isn't just another lark for smith . this movie is about something , and the deeper we get into it , the more we realize how emotionally on-target the script is . alyssa's project is the less testosterone-oriented idiosyncratic routine . but , whether or not it's really love , holden is in for a big surprise because alyssa is a lesbian . his observations about comic books , video games , and other aspects of life in the '90s are as insightful as they often are scathing . but this is nothing new -- it was evident in both clerks and mallrats . what's different here is that smith has crafted a touching , nuanced romance which may be the most memorable screen love affair since before sunrise . there are real human feelings and problems involved in holden and alyssa's relationship , and , every time the storyline threatens to devolve into a cliche , it somehow avoids the trap . there's also a rich subtext pertaining to the difficulty that many individuals face in attaining a level of comfort with their sexual identity . the best scenes are those that explore the evolving relationship between holden and alyssa . ben affleck and joey lauren adams , both veterans of smith films , develop an effective chemistry . adams , who looks a little like cameron diaz and sounds a little like jennifer tilley , displays surprising dramatic range and ability . like clerks , chasing amy doesn't shy away from profane conversations . there's even an instance when oral sex is compared to ( of all things ) the weather channel and cnn ( you'll have to see the movie to understand why ) . in fact , i can't print any of chasing amy's best lines here -- they're all r-rated . chasing amy is entertainment of the best sort . for nearly two hours , it keeps the audience enraptured . there aren't many missteps , and , those few that exist are minor and easily forgiven . chasing amy is touching , funny , sweet , and most important of all , real -- a welcome breath of fresh air . you can't ask for more than that from any motion picture , and you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie in theaters these days that offers anything more appealing , revealing , or enjoyable than kevin smith's third feature .",0.85
"the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality . since he can't find anything phony about these photos , he is pressed into believing that maybe it is possible to prove that there is a spiritual world with such creatures in attendance . his tendency is to believe that faith is what we must live by : "" i don't need proof , faith is enough for me . "" one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head . therefore his story did not have the impact it could have had with a more drawn out response and introspective performance . he was not someone that we could warm up to in an instant without knowing more about him than his tragic loss . now kingsley's role is really structured to fit a rigid character who can't change , yet his presence on screen is dynamic , bringing much more to his villainous role than just that one dimension to it . we might not like him but we have a better understanding of him than we do of charles . wanted to like charles much more than we were given a chance to and we couldn't , mainly because we could never get close enough to him . but that is not to say his performance wasn't good . it was well-suited according to character , but it was not a stirring performance and not one that completely captured our imagination . what results is a film that is beautifully photographed and stimulating to the intellect and freshly innovative . and , for how many films can you say all that is true ? we are led to believe that religion doesn't work because it is too fearful to go inward ; that theosophy doesn't work because it is not a real experience for those partaking in their seances and pseudo-scientific experiments ; and , that science doesn't work because its knowledge is limited . but the love story remains secondary to the ideas presented about the afterworld ; her romantic interest in him just never becomes vital to the story . where the story is strongest and most convincing , is when it tries to debunk both the belief and disbelief in fairies . there is no rational argument he can present to edify what he knows for certain . this is a very intelligent and effective film , that raises many interesting ideas and questions about the supernatural . it is a serious film , that should be seen by an audience that is not afraid of a story with an unhappy ending ; it offers a fresh outlook to a meaningful experience about the afterworld . this topic has been virtually taboo in our culture ever since the '60s drug revolution imploded on the landscape and caused a generational war . but it is now the end of the century , and the questions alluding to a spiritual world and the use of psychedelics as one way to get there , are more relevant than ever . if there are quibbles with this imperfect film , they are not that significant when you consider how well it made its case about an afterworld . this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option . that this mysterious story was so captivating , showing how necessary it was for charles to find his place there and how believable his quest was , speaks highly of how well this film was crafted by the director .",0.7
"over the past few years , american moviegoers have developed something of a taste for certain australian movies . and , while it's not bad enough for me to suggest that it should have been left where it came from , this certainly isn't a shining example of australian cinema . one good clue that a movie is in trouble is when a subplot is more engaging than the main story . the paring afforded the most screen time is easily the least interesting -- sour , dour , womanizing rick dunne ( aden young ) and his soul-mate , melissa morrison ( saffron burrows , of circle of friends ) . or , at least rick thinks it's still there . melissa isn't as sure . all of these things occur at the hotel de love , a cheesy honeymoon spot with theme suites for lovers ( i . e . , spend the night in a room that looks like it's in the middle of a jungle ) . it's not interesting to begin with , and it only gets worse as the film progresses . the two leads , aden young and saffron burrows , do credible jobs , but their characters never connect on any level . the parents subplot , in addition to being horribly written , is even less compelling . on the other hand , i was intrigued enough by stephen and alison that i was willing to sit through the entire film to see how things turned out for them . on some level , it was probably worth the sacrifice , but i'm not sure i'd recommend that anyone else do the same . the comedy in hotel de love is consistently embarrassing . the so- called "" humor "" isn't funny , and it puts the actors in awkward situations . this is the kind of material that often appears on tv sit-coms , when the only way we know we're supposed to find it funny is because of the laugh track . then there's the annoying pop music soundtrack ( a staple of australian comedies ) , which tries to come up with a familiar tune for every occasion . hotel de love is not without its share of interesting ideas -- it just never develops any of them . the two brothers have the kind of love/hate relationship that deserves more than the handful of cursory lines devoted to it . likewise , stephen's hobby -- sitting around at airports counting how many travelers are met by lovers and how many are alone -- could lead to something considerably more substantial that it does . in short , most of the potentially fascinating elements of the film are snubbed because writer/director craig rosenberg is determined to tell rick and melissa's cliched story . and that's unfortunate , because he may be the only one who's interested in watching it .",0.55

"boiling point is basically an average police thriller ( although , surprisingly , there are no high-speed car chases ) with little that's new or original to offer to its audience . it tries to be more intelligent than most movies of the genre , but what passes for a "" higher quality "" script is just a story that's a little less exciting . one of boiling point's main problems is that there isn't a great deal of action and the ending is never in doubt . the few clever plot twists ( none of which are substantial ) don't make up for general lack of energy evident throughout most of the movie . i doubt action fans will enjoy this film much , and those looking for a dramatic picture will be put off by the stock characters and predictable situations . there are a few characters that seem completely irrelevant to the overall plot . many of these are in supporting roles , but one main character , lolita davidovich's vikki , serves no purpose other than to provide a few moments of subtle irony and an opportunity to see other facets of the personalities of jimmy and red . unfortunately , these "" character-building "" moments don't work well . in fact , in a movie with so many scenes designed to show the human sides of both heros and villains , it's surprising that no one attains any great depth . unlike many films that focus on con artists and their scams , boiling point only presents a few run-of-the mill capers . while this naturally limits the scope of the plot , the manner in which the story has been converted to the screen lacks style . it appears that an attempt was made to correct matters in the editing room ( even a casual look reveals that the movie has been heavily edited ) , but there's only so much that can be done in post-production . simply put , boiling point is an unspectacular movie that will vanish as quickly from theaters as it will from the memories of those who see it . it's as mediocre a movie as there ever has been , with very little to like or despise . it certainly isn't the best work done by either wesley snipes or dennis hopper , but neither of them need hang their heads in shame because of it .",0.5

"screenplay : jim kouf and ross lamanna . director : brett ratner . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 96 minutes . life , they say , is all about trade-offs , but rush hour asks for a trade-off that just doesn't seem fair : in order to watch jackie chan in action , you've gotta listen to chris tucker in action . chan is one of the most engaging performers in films , a creater of ingenious martial artistry whose personal charm makes his jaw-dropping stunt work even more fun to watch . tucker , on the other hand , may be the funniest guy on the planet some day , but i'll never know it until he stops reading every line in the mellifluous tones usually associated with a circular saw . chan is great ; tucker is grating . rush hour balances the two nearly perfectly , creating a synthesis that is pure cinematic mediocrity . i suspect tucker might have been thinking of rush hour as his beverly hills cop , a chance to play the street-wise rebel with a badge in an action comedy setting . there's no question that he has his adherents -- the folks in the theater who were howling with glee and stomping their feet at his every bug-eyed shriek -- but i can't see tucker crossing over into the kind of broad popularity enjoyed by eddie murphy . the reason is quite simple : where murphy generally seems amused by the foibles of his on-screen foils , tucker seems perpetually irritated . every canned insult he spews makes him that much more unpleasant to spend time with -- not exactly the vibe you're looking for in a leading man . director brett ratner may not have the visual flair of chan's frequent collaborator stanley tong , but he's smart enough to get out of the way and let chan do his thing ( some sloppy editing choices notwithstanding ) . a jackie chan fight sequence still has the ability to dazzle the way no other fight sequence can , mixing silly bits of business with lighting-fast choreography . rush hour is nothing but fun when it's nothing but a showcase for chan , whether he's fighting bad guys while trying to protect a priceless piece of chinese pottery from harm , or scaling walls and trees in a manner more feline than human . on paper , the collaboration between chan and tucker probably looked like an ideal match of opposites -- one the self-deprecating physical comedian , the other the self-aggrandizing verbal comedian . rush hour is less a jackie chan/chris tucker film than it is a jackie chan film alternating with a chris tucker film , each performer taking turns yanking the predictable material into his preferred comfort zone . if you're a fan of both lead actors , you'll probably get the double-barreled rush the makers of rush hour were aiming for . if you're like me , you'll find it misfiring as often as it hits its target . only then could i safely and happily suspend my disbelief . only then could i forget what i had been forced to endure from the other half of the star tandem . trade-offs can be so cruel . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.5
"the only recent movie quite like american movie was the much better hands on a hardbody , which should be required viewing for anyone who likes either documentaries or comedies . what the two films share is a respectful but honest view of the poor part of america either ignored by hollywood or excessively romanticized . actually , american movie isn't about making a movie , that's just the context within which to tell the story of someone in search of the american dream . were it not for the fabulous success of the blair witch project , we might write-off mark's cheesy , slasher flicks as being forever destined to be financial disasters . but if another indie filmmaker can ride to fame and fortune on something that looks like a bad home video , why not mark , who even shoots with real film rather than videotape ? mark , a likable guy with a scraggy beard and long unkempt hair , talks a mile a minute about his aspirations . "" there's such corny dialog , "" he says of his third draft of northwestern's script , "" that it'd make the pope weep . "" although you'll find mark charming and funny , not everyone has a charitable view of mark's potential . his buddy and fellow filmmaker , mike schank , who looks straight out of central casting , acts like his brain was fried years ago . when reminded by mark , mike just gives him a puppy-dog grin as if to say that if you didn't place the flyers directly into my hands , it can't be my fault . as delightfully inviting as the documentary is , it makes you yearn for a fast-forward button . footage of mark bathing his grandfather might work in some other film , but here it just bogs down the narrative . although the documentary is about mark's films and whether they would ever get distributed , chris smith and sarah price , the two filmmakers on american movie , maxed out their nine credit cards buying film stock for two years , as they followed mark around . and mark , certainly , isn't one who is likely to ever quit . american movie runs too long at 1 : 49 . it is rated r for fake-looking gore and frequent profanity and would be fine for teenagers .",0.7
"kenneth branagh's frankenstein . the latest , and arguably the most ambitious , to enter this potentially-lucrative market is a cinematic version of anne rice's interview with the vampire . the fangs are still present , as are the insatiable bloodlust and fear of daylight , but no longer will religious trappings hold the undead at bay , and a stake through the heart has lost its effectiveness . when interview with the vampire works , it's as compelling and engrossing a piece of entertainment as is available on film today . when it falters , the weaknesses seem magnified . fortunately , under the care of director neil jordan ( the crying game ) , instances of the former are more frequent that those of the latter , although the film noticeably stumbles during two key sequences ( a needlessly drawn-out exploration of life as a vampire in paris and the illogical , dumb conclusion ) . despite the ups and downs of the second half , however , the first hour is classic horror at its most grotesque . in the best tradition of the grand guignol , interview with the vampire revels in its graphic and horrifying bloodiness . tom cruise's lestat is not a consistent villain , nor does he come across as particularly multi-dimensional , but there are times when his screen presence commands attention . most arresting of all is young kirsten dunst , whose charisma is such that she continually steals scenes from her older and more experienced co-stars . here , explicitness is replaced by innuendo . while sex is rarely in the background , it's never on screen , either . homoeroticism , the electra complex , and pedophilia are all hinted at . as horror films go , interview with the vampire has the right look . atmosphere may not be everything , but its importance cannot be understated . with its gothic settings , superlative makeup ( by stan winston ) , and sterling miniatures work , this film can claim visuals nearly on par with those of kenneth branagh's stylish frankenstein . there are other parallels between these films , not the least of which is their equally erratic pacing . however , interview's plot is probably more coherent and its characters somewhat better realized . there are flaws to be found here--even for those not specifically looking--but for the simple horrific pleasure offered , they can be set aside , if not entirely ignored .",0.77
"actually , any kind of road picture could have been used to tell this oddly-compelling tale . dead man is an undeniably strange movie , and sometimes it's hard to figure out what to make of it . filmed in black-and-white with an eerie score by neil young , and using contemporary dialogue and mannerisms , jarmusch's picture has a dream-like quality . it's filled with irony and subtle humor , but contains a serious message about the fragility and uncertainty of human existence . even if it accomplishes little else , dead man will almost certainly inspire thought and discussion . this isn't the kind of movie that can be digested easily or immediately . although i don't have all the answers , i recognize that this provocative , puzzling movie will stay with you long after the twangy strains of neil young's end credit music have faded away .",0.7
"now here is a concept for a movie , how about dead poets' society goes to sea ? so you are not enthralled ? well , too bad , that movie has been produced , and it is called white squall . this is a movie that should have never been made . it is a low quality rehash of the classic teaching high school kids movie that has been made more times than i can count . this picture has nothing original to say , and the acting is way below par . imagine making a show about kids and then not putting in a single kid ( or adult for that matter ) that you care about . there must have been a dozen or so boys . sailing was not like this in my day . guess it got a safer quickly since 1960 . the derivative script by todd robinson is filled with cliches . sure . another shoots a dauphin just because . there is not much of a story really just a series of almost unrelated and completely trivial incidents . i will not give away anymore other than to say they did not choose the title of the movie at random . there is no chemistry among the boys or among anyone else in the cast . there is not a single decent acting job by any of the boys . none of the characters are acted believably thanks to poor direction by ridley scott . i know it is a true story , but somehow i do not think the kids were really this boring or the captain this mean . bridges's performance is especially pathetic . he never warms up to the part and seems to be spaced out in most of the scenes as if he wishes he were somewhere else rather than in this film . sometimes they use extreme close-ups for reasons i could not figure out . there is a single good part of this movie . since my wife and i spent eleven wonderful ten day thanksgiving holidays in a row there , it brought back wonderful images to my brain . too bad we have not been there in years , but the movie served as a one minute travelogue for me . now , that is it ; there is nothing else worth seeing in this film . white squall runs way too long at 2 : 08 thanks to a lack of serious editing by gerry hambling . the first part is excruciatingly slow . the movie is rated pg-13 for violence and a little bad language . there is no sex or nudity . there is nothing here that would harm teenagers other than boredom . i do not recommend this show to anyone , and i give it 1/2 of a star . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.2

"it was suddenly possible to see humans and dinosaurs interacting in a way that had never before been possible , and to feel the entire theater shake with the approach of a tyrannosaurus rex . effects houses like industrial lights and magic have tackled bigger , more imposing objects such as tornadoes and volcanoes , but it's still basically the same technology that jurassic park ushered in . and , because the lost world doesn't offer anything especially innovative , it seems rather familiar and almost ( but not quite ) disappointing . like its predecessor , the lost world is basically a big-budget monster movie of the sort that has been popular ever since the dawn of motion pictures . unfortunately , like many entries into the genre , it falls into expected patterns . as a result , much of this movie seems like a retread of jurassic park ( with a little king kong thrown in at the end ) , not because director steven spielberg is intentionally copying himself , but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise . if there's a third movie in the series , it will probably follow pretty much the same storyline as the first and second installments . still , repetitiveness notwithstanding , the lost world boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments . the standout sequence in this film features two t- rexs , a lot of rain , spiderweb fissures in glass , and a literal cliffhanger . next year's godzilla will hopefully do a more impressive job with the "" dinosaur loose in a city "" concept . returning from the first film is jeff goldblum as dr . ian malcolm , a mathematician with an analytical mind and a wry sense of humor . the differences between jurassic park and the lost world can be summed up relatively simply : more dinosaurs , fewer legitimate thrills . in this case , familiarity doesn't breed contempt , but it results in a movie that's unlikely to keep viewers going back time-after-time the way they did for the original . the lost world is solid entertainment the first time ; it's not something i have any great desire to sit through again . if so , it really doesn't work . the self-deprecating scientist is likable exclusively because of jeff goldblum ; even after two films , he's still relatively one-dimensional . meanwhile , arliss howard represents the obligatory nasty corporate villain type . perhaps the most disappointing thing about the lost world is how perfunctory and unimaginative steven spielberg's direction often is . in his more than two decades of film making , spielberg has been responsible for a variety of innovative action/adventure movies -- jaws , raiders of the lost ark , and jurassic park , to name a few . the magical spark that characterizes so many spielberg films is largely absent . it is to this year what independence day was to last year -- the summer's single "" can't miss "" motion picture ( or so the advertisers would have us believe ) . it also comes early enough in the season so that we're not already sick to death of this kind of effects-oriented action/adventure . so , although the lost world has its share of problems , chief of which is the familiarity factor , it still offers a couple hours of glitzy , hi-tech fun . and that's just about all that anyone can reasonably expect from this kind of blockbuster .",0.7

"message in a bottle ( warner bros . ) starring : kevin costner , robin wright penn , paul newman , illeana douglas . producers : denise di novi , jim wilson and kevin costner . director : luis mandoki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . you can imagine newman both as a man's man -- a loner dedicated to his craft -- and a ladies' man -- deeply sensitive when touched by the love of a good woman . that's the kind of screen presence you need when you're dealing with one of these mythically appealing romances like the bridges of madison county or the horse whisperer . you need a clint eastwood , or a robert redford . . . or a paul newman . costner . yet here he is in message in a bottle , playing the emotionally unavailable but romantically irresistable garret . he's the kind of guy who loves too deeply , whose gestures of self-sacrifice are the stuff of song and story . it's costner once again as the paradigm , the icon , and i for one didn't believe him for a second . to be fair , costner isn't the only thing wrong with message in a bottle . director luis mandoki's adaptation is a technically glorious piece of work -- beautifully photographed by caleb deschanel , sweepingly scored by gabriel yared -- but it's one heck of a long sit , clocking in at a soggy two hours and fifteen minutes . the storyline parallels theresa's emergence from emotional isolation after a difficult divorce with garret's difficulties letting go of his wife , and does so in fetishistic detail . there's a subplot involving garret's conflict with his embittered in-laws , and the occasional tete-a-tete between dodge and garret or between dodge and theresa , all building with a gruelling lack of tension to one big cathartic payoff . you may leave the theater with your hanky wet , but it could be from the drool that collects while you nod off to sleep just as easily as from tears . lost at sea along the way are extremely effective performances by robin wright penn and paul newman . wright penn is an actress we don't see very much , which allows her still to be an actress in a role like this rather than a movie star . her conflicted pursuit of garret -- a man whose letters should have told her from the start isn't ready to love anyone else -- is convincing in context ; her moments of insecurity and disappointment are genuinely affecting . newman , meanwhile , gets to be gruff in a way that usually turns actors into hams , but turns this veteran into a breath of fresh air . he's so effortlessly charming , it's easy to forget the harlequin sensibility at the heart of message in a bottle and begin enjoying it as human relationship drama . costner , too , can be effortlessly charming , but not here . his interpretation of the role is so focused on garret's internalized mourning that in the moments when he's supposed to be letting go with theresa , he looks like a man trying to act like a grieving man trying to be effortlessly charming . message in a bottle undoubtedly will have its sob appeal , just as the novel did . unlike the film adaptations of the bridges of madison county and the horse whisperer , that's the main thing this one has going for it . it's too bad it couldn't have been made twenty-five years ago , when paul newman hadn't yet handed over the iconic roles to actors ill-suited to handling them . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"perspective is a curious matter . sometimes , a thing is entirely how you look at it rather than the thing itself . even in the mind , style can triumph over substance . there is an abundance of style on display in three seasons , enough to cloak its lapses in substance . the narrative consists of four largely independent stories of life in modern saigon . visually , three seasons is a remarkably assured piece of film-making , using the contrasts of ancient , war-time and modern vietnam to perfection . cinematographer lisa rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm glow , helping make three seasons an often enchanting tone poem on the conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional . as a narrative , it's considerably more inconsistent , as one might expect from the multiple independent story-lines . by far the most effective is the tale of cyclo driver hai , given the strongest emotional and thematic pull by don duong's exceptional performance . at its core his is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story , yet something in duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant , his attempts to "" save "" lan more ennobling than predictable . each of the other tales has its moments , but they come more sporadically . keitel's american perspective feels particularly intrusive , almost like a sop to american audiences ; what's more , it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons . though three seasons rarely inspires seat-shifting , it's never as engaging as it is when the focus is on hai . still , the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing , of reconciling vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and future . as the first american production shot in vietnam since the war , it's also an often-compelling cultural document . there's little doubt that three seasons feels somehow more "" significant "" because it is so gracefully and beautifully composed , but that's hardly a cause for consternation . if it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons , that only proves that glamour can change one's perspective , as it clearly has in a post-war saigon where coke adds life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.7

"" oscar-worthy "" is an overused term , but it applies in this case . not many of his films have been box office successes , but harris' performances have never been the problem . harris' frank isn't developed with the subtlety of duvall's walt , but frank is a much more boisterous and raucous personality . the three women have supporting roles . sandra bullock is likable as elaine , the only under-fifty member of the cast . shirley maclaine doesn't have much to do as helen coonie , but she asserts her presence effectively in two pivotal scenes . piper laurie's georgia is pretty much a wasted character , and ms . laurie's performance is the only one that's below the expected level . as is the case with many movies that deal with friendship and aging issues , wrestling ernest hemingway doesn't go anywhere . that's not really a problem , but the total length of the movie could have been cut by about fifteen minutes without losing anything . this film doesn't need to be two hours long . humor and pathos are nicely mixed , but this is expected from any moderately-successful entry into the genre . in may ways , this is the male version of the cemetery club , with many of the same themes confronted from the other gender's point-of-view . wrestling ernest hemingway is more entertaining--the cemetery club never quite clicked--but those who have seen both films will recognize the similarities . warner brothers is having a hard time promoting wrestling ernest hemingway , and the likely result will be a poor showing at the box office . they have an understandable problem , since the movie doesn't offer a whole lot of quick clips to attract viewers . it's a shame , really , because while this movie has its fair share of flaws , there is an audience for it . the problem is that they probably won't know that it exists .",0.68
"once again , orion pictures has gone to the shelves to dust off a print for distribution . this time , it's the last feature of the late director tony richardson--a muddled melodrama wrapped around a cautionary tale about the dangers of nuclear fallout . the 1991 film shows its age with shots of chris o'donnell and amy locane looking significantly less mature than in some of their more recent screen appearances . blue sky is a dreary , disjointed affair that tries to tie together an anti-nuclear message with a family-in-crisis melodrama . the most significant problem is that the script is more dysfunctional than the marshall clan . at no time is there a clear sense that this movie is going in any particular direction . it lurches along until stumbling upon something that passes for a conclusion . the dissection of marshall's home life is potentially more interesting . however , a resolutely downbeat tone ( not necessarily a bad thing in itself ) coupled with an agonizing example of over-the-top acting by lange ( reminiscent of the quality of her "" work "" in 1976's king kong ) conspire to ruin these portions of blue sky . the ubiquitous tommy lee jones gives a surprisingly bland performance . maybe it's the character , but there isn't much here for the audience to latch on to or care about . powers boothe , playing a stereotyped nasty commanding officer with an inflexible mindset , is lifeless . despite being one of several obvious villains , his vince johnson is too dull to actively dislike . for those who crave originality , there's very little of value in blue sky . this is unfortunate , considering that the film was the final effort of a respected director . since their chapter 11 filing , it seems that every time orion pictures gropes for something to release , it comes up with a dud . i suppose the library of undistributed movies must be as bankrupt as the company itself .",0.38

"what have we come to as a culture that we can look with nostalgia at the events of a mere decade ago ? to most people nostalgia means events that happened several decades ago . even films about the 70s like the ice storm and boogie nights seem to be covering a time that happened too recently to parody with bad clothes and ridiculous sets . the wedding singer attempts a nostalgic look at the classic period of the mid-1980s , 1985 to be precise . although most people will have trouble remembering how 1985 was different from today , the wedding singer clears it up . in the previous decade we wore incredibly bad clothes with heavy reliance on clashing colors of lavender , pink , and lime green . our tastes in household decorations looked like an updated version of the ticky-tacky 50s . how soon we forget how awful we were . the wedding singer frustrates and delights with equal measures . one minute it is an over-the-top comedy that is gratingly bad , and the next it is a surprising sweet and touching little romance . director frank coraci exerts little control over his picture , which drifts aimlessly from bad to good and then back again . with long hair and a completely different look and approach , happy gilmore's star , adam sandler , plays robby . his uneven performance can be blamed partly on the script by tim herlihy , who also penned happy gilmore , but it is mostly sandler's own fault . the main reason , other than the energetic music , for the success of the movie is the lovely performance by the female lead , drew barrymore . julia is engaged and her romance , like robby's , is equally ill-fated . in the predictable , but none the less charming , romance developing between them , robby and julia don't realize that they are in love until almost the end . it isn't until julia practices her wedding ceremony kiss with robby -- she's not sure the degree of tongue that is appropriate in a church setting -- that they realize that they have the hots for each other . when robby isn't doing something stupid like the embarrassingly bad scene in which he ruins someone else's wedding party just because he is depressed , the chemistry between julia and robby is genuine and captivating . drew barrymore has innocence down pat . the supporting cast has lots of promise , partially realized . if -- and that's a big if -- you can ignore the stupefyingly bad comedy , you will find that the movie has a big heart underneath . rewritten this could be a wonderful movie . even as it is , it still has a lot to recommend it . it is rated pg-13 for sex-related material and language and would be fine for kids around ten and up .",0.6

"this is an awkward comedy made just before kurosawa's breakthrough film , rashomon . but hiruta is not reliable , as he explains himself , saying people used to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses , so he now uses trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics . the film switches tracks , as the two leads are not particularly interesting types , but the flawed hiruta makes for a more compelling story , so he becomes the main focus of the film . the courtroom is filled with contrivances , as the story befits a tacky soap opera . you can't beat that for pouring on the goo ! supposedly this film is a parody of the japanese willingness to accept america's foreign culture as theirs . kurosawa is an overrated director outside of shooting an action film , who can't shoot a dramatic film without laying on an overdose of goo . here he has mifune and the concert singer become sexless , while the publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain , and the lawyer's fall and redemption are just too predictable to have any effect . there is something caustic in this story , but its overall effect is ruined by too much that is an obvious delineation of what is good and evil . i found the message awkwardly delivered and unconvincing , and the acting was especially bad , as the lines as rendered seemed to be mechanical and not instinctive , it was as if all the actors attended a school for bad actors and learned to act by being didactic . this film hardly had a pulse , just a message it kept sending out in a not too subtle way .",0.4

"this innocent comedy from spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a home run with its humor . it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna . the film's main asset is its popular star , carmen maura , considered by many spanish film critics to be spain's most accomplished actress . if you like that sort of comedy , then you might like this film . the story is probably autobiographical : the heroine ( carmen maura ) is a journalist named carmen , and the film is layed out in four sections , just like a newspaper , but here the divisions relate to the time of season . all the fights are mild and over the most trivial of things , which is supposed to make this very materially comfortable couple look ridiculous , since it is obvious that they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be fighting all the time . she then tells him , "" the watch only looks expensive , it was really quite cheap .

"in the first place , although set it off contains some dramatic elements , it is , first and foremost , an action/caper film . secondly , all things considered , this is a much better picture . if set it off owes a debt to recent films , it's more to dead presidents and thelma and louise than to waiting to exhale . the concept of four black action heroines makes for a welcome change in a genre that is dominated by : ( a ) rugged white males with a perpetual five o'clock shadow , ( b ) rugged white males who speak english with an accent , and ( c ) rugged white males with the acting ability of a fence post . there's a freshness and energy in the way director f . gary gray attacks this familiar material that keeps set it off entertaining , even during its weakest moments . the film doesn't get off to a promising start . there are a few too many contrivances and coincidences . the remainder of the film , which includes several high-adrenaline action sequences and some slower , more dramatic moments , is smoothly-crafted . there are occasional missteps , such as an out-of-place godfather parody , but , in general , set it off manages to rise above these . pinkett is backed by a solid cast , and the chemistry between the performers helps us believe that there's a real friendship going on . rap artist-turned-actress queen latifa brings a toughness to her role that recalls blaxploitation star pam grier . what sets this movie apart from the innumerable other entries into the action/caper genre is its social perspective . set it off doesn't preach , but you'd have to be blind not to recognize that there's a message here about the kind of desperation that can result from the familiar cycle of poverty , sexism , and racism . and , although the marketing for set it off is geared primarily towards african americans , you don't have to be black to appreciate this effective , in-your-face style of film making .",0.7

"" in fact , red planet resolutely refuses to deal with anything beyond the basic goals of its characters to find a way back to earth . what exactly was the reason that no one could detect any oxygen , when it turns out there's a whole lot of it around ? and why flirt with the notion that there's some intelligence bent on thwarting the terraforming effort , only to make the real villain of the piece the crew's resident malfunctioning evil robot ? silly questions , of course , since red planet is kind enough to alert you so quickly to its minimalist intentions . the characters spout dialogue that alternates between inane exposition and pointless self-characterization .

"ballard cinematography : peter suschitzky music : howard shore u . s . distributor : fine line features it has been called brave , rousing , and shocking . at the 1996 cannes film festival , where it received its world premiere , it was both hailed and booed , and received a special jury prize for "" originality , daring , and audacity . "" yet for all the opinions floating around about how ground-breaking and controversial crash is , i found it to be something of a letdown . crash has a couple of concepts which are , admittedly , fascinating and original , but not a whole lot more . the movie tries to milk these themes for one-hundred minutes , but basically runs out of interesting material in less than a third of that time . from the half-hour point on , crash subsists on style alone . it's a slim cinematic diet that will have viewers squirming in their seats long before the end credits roll . despite all the naked flesh and flashy car accidents , crash is basically a bore . ballard , deals with what variety dubbed "" auto-eroticism "" . the more serious the crash , the more powerful the stimulation . penetration , whether of flesh into flesh , metal into metal , or metal into flesh , leads to release , either of sexual energy , life , or both . it's well known that for some people , a sense of danger enhances sex . there are those who crave sadomasochistic role- playing . and , as depicted here , there are those who get off on car crashes . they can be participants or observers , but , in the presence of such raw destructive power and mayhem , they become aroused . all of this sounds reasonably interesting , and it is , at least for about half an hour . in the wake of the initial flurry of eye-opening material , the film is content to re-tread the same ideas , never striking out in new directions or offering a different approach . there's no plot to speak of -- just a series of visceral images loosely strung together to approximate a narrative . more importantly and most frustratingly , there's no real character development . the five main figures are ciphers and mouthpieces for cryptic ideas , not legitimate personalities . we never connect with them on an emotional , psychological , or intellectual level . they're script constructs , necessary only because cronenberg needs one or two-dimensional people to convey certain themes . the aspect of crash most likely to retain a viewer's attention is its style . cronenberg , along with cinematographer peter suschitzky , has given this film a darkly original look , filled with shocking images of violent crashes and raw sex . often , watching crash makes you feel like a voyeur peeping through blinds or glancing covertly at a roadside collision . the three females all bring something interesting to their performances . hunter allows helen to be uncertain of the implications surrounding her newly-discovered fetish , unger mixes pathos with a strangely icy sensuality , and arquette is both sexy and vulnerable in her metal-and-leather outfit . from an acting standpoint , the weak link is james spader , who mistakenly thinks that the blandness he exhibited in sex , lies , and videotape serves him well here . his character is poorly developed to begin with ; spader does nothing to invest ballard with any additional life . there are many movie-goers who will see crash exclusively because it has caused such a stir , and many more who will avoid it for the same reason . however , while there is a lot of sex in the film , the nc-17 rating seems more obligatory than necessary . there's nothing exceptionally graphic or startling here . if not for the quantity of sex shots and the somewhat-kinky nature , a hard r would have been equally appropriate . as for crash's substance -- the film presents some provocative ideas , but , without characters or a plot to deliver them , they have a minimal impact .",0.5
"i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western , but is shot in the '60s style of "" point blank , "" and is scripted by lem dobbs , most probably , for the entertainment value it provides . i also know that a limey is a slang term for a brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by terence stamp . the story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to some future thing he wants to do , therefore the time sequence is often confusing . if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very titillating feature , it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is , unless from all the garbled cockney sayings by wilson , this is a film about what the meaning of one's life is , as a senior citizen who had plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought , as we see that he from time-to-time reflects on that subject . in any case , this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful to behold . it is also a film about nostalgia , as it brings back haunting memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion . the '60s are dismissed here , as only being what happened in 1966- and early '67 , and that golden "" hippie "" age is further reduced to a few golden moments of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene . steven sodergergh ( sex , lies , and videotape/kafka/schizopolis/out of sight ) has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more . the director makes frequent flashback cuts to the stamp of younger film days , using the 1967 film he was in , as it becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it , not excluding the former real-life film roles of its present iconic stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen . perhaps , the '60s itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was manipulated by those who knew better , like the terry valentine's of the world . therefore style over substance isn't all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveau-noir work , that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe it's just that the king's english , even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent , sounds so worthwhile , that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language , that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical .",0.7

"only a year later , smith made a studio-financed follow-up called mallrats , a film so widely reviled that smith publicly apologized for it , announcing "" i don't know what i was thinking . "" though he sometimes explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity , smith gives chasing amy both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about the complications of sexual politics . for the first half-hour of chasing amy , kevin smith concentrates on churning out the laughs with his often-crude , usually pop-culture-heavy dialogue . he shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay black comic book writer ( dwight ewell ) who is forced to keep up a public image as a militant afro-centrist -- and a conversation about archie and jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced tarantino-as-a-slacker quality . smith even pulls off a riff on jaws in which banky and alyssa compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature richard dreyfuss and a lesbian robert shaw ( though the flashback literalization of those stories is ill-advised ) . while the jokes are rarely profound , they are usually effective and delivered with zing by the actors . it doesn't help that two of the longer speeches are delivered by joey lauren adams , a talented actress but one whose jennifer tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force her to wail for several minutes at a time . smith clearly wants to stretch himself beyond satiric comedy , but he never quite finds a pace which gives the more serious moments in chasing amy a spark to match their sincerity . it's a shame smith's romantic observations never quite click as drama , because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is served up in contemporary romantic comedies . there is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way smith develops his characters , and he shows keen insight into how different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior . it's simply clear that smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting around talking , and that style works much better with comedy than with drama . when it is at its funniest , chasing amy reminds you why everyone was so high on kevin smith in the wake of clerks . and even when it falters as a drama , it proves that smith isn't content with making clerks over and over . or , perhaps more important , that he won't make mallrats over and over .",0.7

"billy bob thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in sling blade : i don't know where to begin praising him . there are writers who get a shot at directing films , and actors who do some writing , and film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera , but in most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct , or an actor write , or a director act . in sling blade , you never feel as though you are watching a writer try to act , or an actor try to direct . you realize you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the words , the performers and the images are not discrete elements , but indivisible parts of a cohesive story . his setting , an insular southern town , is rendered with a vivid combination of characters and locations ; his characters , down to the last minor player , are given personalities uniquely their own . but it is the remarkable dexterity with which thornton weaves the threads of his story that makes sling blade so powerful . karl's story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right thing , but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that right thing is supposed to be . playing someone with a mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in acting ( right up there with playing an alcoholic ) , because it is so easy to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul . the former can be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry , with dustin hoffman in rain man and geoffrey rush in shine as a couple of showy recent examples . neither of those roles , however , showed us a character trying to grow as a person , and that is what thornton accomplishes in sling blade . while thornton does turn in an exceptional physical performance , which his polite demeanor and quirky speech patterns , he does not allow karl to be defined by the way he talks . this isn't a character you feel sorry for , like a pet ; this is a man you feel for as a fellow human being . thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his entire cast , particularly dwight yoakam ( yes , _that_ dwight yoakam ) as the cruel doyle . he is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the difference , and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster . complexities spill over from sling blade , a film so perfectly crafted and acted from the moment karl leaves the hospital that i wish thornton had reconsidered the first fifteen minutes . it is an awkward conceit which gets sling blade off to an uneven start , but it is just as well thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director . with the kind of flawless work he does as writer and star of sling blade , he might have become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well .",1
"director : brian helgeland . lots of action films go the anti-hero route , offering protagonists with single-sentence motivations who kill at least as many people as the ostensible villains of the piece . the assumption is that we'll be on the side of the star because . . . well , it doesn't matter how nasty or brutal arnold schwarzenegger or steven seagal get -- if they're the first name on the marquee , they're the ones whose gunplay and fisticuffs are cheered . mel gibson is a different case entirely . there has always been something genuinely unstable behind his eyes when he wants there to be -- mad max , the original lethal weapon , conspiracy theory -- but also something genuinely wounded that makes his instability as sympathetic as it is menacing . along the way to his goal , porter encounters plenty of intriguing characters , which is half the fun of payback . payback works in large part because it's not just mel gibson running around shooting and getting shot at . the whole atmosphere of the film is bleak and corrupt , from ericson core's bleached cinematography to the cold brick of richard hoover's production design . though it comes with a dose of humor , it's usually humor of the black variety , and the film rarely strays far from pulp crime thriller territory . there's violence , and then there's _violence_ , and then there's payback , which never shies away from the roughest rough stuff from the opening scene of un-anesthetized surgery . where a slap might suffice , a pistol-whipping shows up instead ; where you might expect a good old-fashioned roughing up , you can count on the strategic application of a sledgehammer . porter's world is certainly a brutal one , and porter himself is a brutal guy , but after a while it all starts to feel like overkill . you reach the point where you don't need to see val beat up a woman and shoot a dog to figure out that he's not too nice a guy . fortunately , it all comes back to gibson , whose monomania about his $70 , 000 makes just enough sense to keep the plot moving . there's a bit too much effort directed towards making porter seem sensitive through his relationship with a high-priced call girl ( maria bello ) -- apparently the result of gibson's initial dissatisfaction with director and co-writer brian helgeland's relentlessly dark tone -- but it all seems like unnecessary effort . payback only works as entertainment because gibson himself conveys all the reason we need to get behind porter . if you can get past all the bloodshed and brutality , you'll find a surprisingly slick and surprisingly smart action thriller in payback . the amazing thing is that , by all rights , you _shouldn't_ be able to get past it . credit gibson for giving us the kind psycho you can't help cuddling up to . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.7

"not to be glib , but there are two very simple reasons why so many romantic comedies are so bad : 1 ) no romance ; 2 ) no comedy . the structure is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys -- find two characters , put them together , introduce an obstacle , tear them apart , resolve the obstacle , bring them back together again . that's where every romantic comedy script begins , and sadly , that's also where most of them end . see , there's the not-so-small matter of creating two likeable characters whose pairing is as plausible as their separation , as well as entertaining the audience along the way to the foregone conclusion . when your audience is ready and willing to be charmed , a film's inability to generate wit or warmth is inexcusable . anna , the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage , is understandably guarded ; william , though a bit dazzled , is understated in his treatment of the star . the romantic side of notting hill works most effectively because curtis and director roger michell ( persuasion ) allow it to develop in stages . crackling with chemistry together , both stars give assured , engaging performances while still leaving a few rough edges -- anna's prickly preoccupation with the perils of her fame , william's addiction to the "" love heroin "" of his romance with a star . it's convenient that the writer who can put these romantic developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working . curtis -- a co-creator of both the wonderfully wordy "" blackadder "" and the purely physical "" mr . bean -- has always had an impressive comic range . the solid supporting cast , including tim mcinnerny , hugh bonneville and emma chambers , comes through with appealing work , but it's curtis' wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy high . notting hill does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy 125 minutes , dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree . in fact , there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed , with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early . the technical glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance unabashedly into a confection that's pure hollywood , and not just because one of the characters is a hollywood star . this is romantic comedy in an old-fashioned sense , where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging than from foolish details like whether the relationship is "" realistic .

"they are the times that can make me begin to question what it is i am looking for in escapist entertainment , as i read raves for hyped-up disappointments like twister and mission : impossible and wonder what it is that i am supposed to be missing . they are the times when a piece of fluff like dragonheart seems that much better when compared to the competition , and they are the times when a film like the arrival , lacking a big star or never-before-seen special effects , will likely drown in a sea of higher-profile releases . but the arrival is the kind of thriller which reminds me _exactly_ what i'm looking for in escapist entertainment : a script which has genuine wit , genuine intelligence , and genuine excitement , and which convinces me that the writer spent at least as much time creating it as i spent watching it . that perfectly describes the arrival . the arrival marks the directing debut of writer david twohy ( the fugitive and the under-appreciated terminal velocity ) , and he demonstrates such a keen understanding of what makes an action thriller work that it seems he was born for the job . in the first minute of the film , he grabbed me by the collar with a beautifully constructed opening sequence , and for the next 109 minutes he simply refused to let go . there are sequences in the arrival which play like textbook examples of how to build tension , particularly one involving a room full of scorpions which is guaranteed to have you squirming if you have a pulse . there is a kind of suspense which plots based on paranoia are much better at generating , and twohy nails it , as well as turning it to humorous effect by connecting the greenhouse effect and the failure of the hubble telescope to alien visitors . that is really what separates the arrival from the pack : a sense of humor which surpasses most of the so-called comedies i see in any given year . sheen has a solid , deadpan sense of comic timing which worked well with twohy's terminal velocity script , and again he wraps each line in a wry self-awareness . zane is not a particularly dynamic role -- he's gung-ho about finding extra-terrestrial life , but it's never quite clear why -- and another actor might have given it more depth . however , sheen makes the comic lines feel un-scripted , and he appears to be adept at playing twohy's favored hero -- a resourceful individual whose actions under duress seem natural and basically intelligent . plus , there is a priceless irony to sheen , the most notorious and unapologetic customer of "" hollywood madam "" heidi fleiss , reading the line , "" there's something to be said for abstinence .

( "" say you're my baby , "" kevin coos demandingly . the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers .",0.3
"clint eastwood has directed a so-so , pleasantly watchable , leisurely-moving film , marked by two outstanding performances . the other is by kevin spacey . there were just too many zanies , causing me to overdose on them . so much of the film seemed to be taken up by these artificial and embarrassingly contrived characters , and not enough to the interesting story that was developing . to the film's credit , it takes no fixed position on the sexual morality questions that come into play . it seems that almost everyone in town has some sort of a pistol , as much is made of the guests carrying pistols to the party . so the killing by pistol doesn't become the big issue , but the fact that jim has come out of the closet , that does not seem to be tolerated in savannah's high society or by the ordinary folks who will make-up the jury . the film then turns into a courtroom drama , and sonny seiler shines as the silky tongued , good ole country boy lawyer . he just seems to get by with that cute smile of his . the film suffers from any real emotion , as it is difficult to be too concerned about the victim or the accused , or for that matter , any of the denizens of savannah . it is interesting to note that the real sonny seiler played the judge . spacey's charm and wit carry this film about as far as it can go , before the meandering story , and the non-mystery of the main event come to fruition . we are left with a colorful , well photographed piece , trying to subtly make a statement on morality . but that didn't work for me . yet , i still found enough good things in the film to say that it might not please everyone , but it did catch the proper atmosphere in savannah and provided an entertaining look at the people who dwell there .",0.5
"i suppose high art is as good a name as any for this pretentious melodrama , an often-diverting but ultimately pointless attempt to wed intellectual twaddle with a soap-opera-ish lesbian romance . lisa cholodenko's film , which had its world premiere in competition at the 1998 sundance film festival , received a decidedly mixed reception there , but was widely praised by feminists more because of its theme of female empowerment than because of a particularly original or engaging script . these are both real characters beset by believable angst . the attraction is palpable and both actresses give capable performances . ally sheedy , who is best known for undemanding roles ( such as in the breakfast club and only the lonely ) , is surprisingly effective cast against type ( although i think some of the praise heaped upon her for this role has been overstated ? she's good , but not excellent ) . frankly , though , i wish the movie had spent a little more time concentrating on syd alone and less on her sexual liaison with lucy . although better developed than most motion picture lesbian affairs , it's fundamentally not all that compelling . her script delves into themes of female empowerment , the war between ambition and affection , the effects of star power , and the balance between art and commercialism . none of these ideas ( many of which are glossed over ) are effectively presented . they are either woven into the plot in an obvious , chunky fashion ( all that's missing is a neon sign saying "" look ! important issue ahead ! "" ) or introduced through the pretentious drivel that the characters spout at one another . aside from syd and lucy , the characters are either irritating or complete non-entities . all men fall into the latter category . visually , high art is impressive . the film's appearance is , as the title implies , artistic , and cholodenko's presentation of the female/female sex scene is lush and sensual . the director also displays an aptitude for developing atmosphere ( consider , for example , the exotic setting of lucy's apartment ) . however , while such a sumptuous style makes it more enjoyable to look at the picture , it's far from everything needed for a successful endeavor . despite solid performances in the two major roles , high art's script is too talky and uneven to make this really worthwhile , unless , of course , you're a fan of arty soap operas .

"actress jennifer jason leigh has tremendous talent , and i have been a fan of hers for some time now . although she has been the best part of many films , my favorite pictures of hers are single white female and georgia . the only bad performance i ever saw her give was in kansas city , and i blame that more on robert altman's direction than her acting . luckily , i had never seen the film . at the of this review i have included some of the leigh's comments on the picture . ( earlier in the day at another film at the festival i looked at the woman sitting near me and reflected to myself , "" hmm , she looks like jennifer jason leigh . "" i glanced again , and thought to myself , "" that's because she is jennifer jason leigh !

's bleak novel and bring it to the screen without apology . the heterosexuals hate and torment the homosexuals . the sets are gritty and full of tacky furniture from the 1950s . the cinematography by stefan czapsky is dark and somber with heavy shadows in every scene . i am not sure that you would be able to see it very well on a television since the contrast is so low . mark knopfler's ominous music takes place on the low registers with notes that are out slow and painful . the show is multilayered and has a large cast . although tralala is the glue that holds the story together , many of the parts both large and small are particularly well done . the best performance is leigh's . sal views injuring georgette as little more than sport . the film deals realistically and frighteningly with the problem of homophobic violence . in one scene georgette is stabbed , and the blood spurts like an artery was punctured . cinequest warned us in advance of the intensity of the picture , and they were right . there is one optimistic person in the film . after the film , leigh said that the incident was necessary and without it the film "" would have been a cheat . "" this scene should have gotten an nc-17 rating for the picture . i believe in 1989 the only choices were r and x so given that perhaps the r rating it got was correct at the time . after the ending , there is a brief epilogue . in it the first rays of hope shine through . like the first sunshine after a hurricane , its warmth felt soothing and somehow tranquil . after the film finished , leigh answered questions about it . she said that she really wanted the part of tralala , but patricia arquette was originally cast for it . none of the names were familiar to me . looking at paintings was not something i expected . "" it is showing you a world without love , "" she said when asked what the movie's message was . leigh said the film was good for her since it forced her , for the first time , to get in touch with her feelings . "" i love it , "" she retorted . an actress with a lot of talent , and one not afraid of speaking her mind . it is rated r for explicit and violent sex , nudity , graphic violence , dope smoking and profanity . the film is for adults and not for teenagers . although granted the film will be too intense for some , i give it thumbs up and * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 31 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7
"1988's wings of desire was an excellent example of a true "" art film , "" with the medium of cinema used as a canvas by a director ( wim wenders , in this case ) . wings of desire was a provocative , evocative look at life , love , and humanity that was at times spiritually elevating and at others pretentious and silly . at the conclusion of the movie , we were promised a sequel , but it has taken six years for the next chapter , faraway , so close ! as faraway , so close ! faraway , so close ! whereas this portion of the first movie made up the bulk of the running time , in the sequel , it's merely a prologue . as wings was damiel's story , so faraway is cassiel's . this is not the light , mystical romance of its predecessor , but a somewhat muddled narrative that ends up resembling an offbeat action/adventure movie . it's still a film about issues--humanity , the soul , time , and nazism--but it lacks many of the "" art "" aspect of wings , relying more on straightforward storytelling . there's a lot about the climactic struggle that doesn't work . even though we aren't given a heavy dose of hollywood-type violence , the sequence seems wrong not only for the film , but for the series as a whole . anyone watching the beginning of wings will find it difficult to come to grips with this as the story's culmination . the cast is excellent . obviously , otto sander has the most difficult role , and he carries it out impeccably . horst buchholz plays his role as the american-type gangster with relish , and willem dafoe is suitably creepy in an ambiguous , and largely unexplained , part . even though this movie is in many ways more straightforward than the original , it is still likely to appeal only to a select audience . mr . wenders has intentionally taken faraway , so close ! the characters are the same , but the circumstances are often vastly different , as are the methods of storytelling . about the only thing i can say regarding a recommendation is that a viewing of wings of desire is almost mandatory before seeing faraway , so close ! going into this film without the background of its predecessor will leave a movie-goer adrift and confused . on the other hand , sitting through wings of desire doesn't guarantee enjoyment of the sequel ( in fact , many fans of the first will probably be sorely disappointed by the turn that this script takes ) , but going cold into faraway , so close ! will almost certainly lead to a negative experience .",0.69

"the major revision is that the film goes from being a full fledged movie to a good sitcom episode . the actors are pleasant enough , and there are several nice chuckles , but marshall is content with letting everyone glide along on autopilot . bestowing on holiday audiences a film that teaches good morals and is for the whole family is definitely commendable . and certainly , funny little sitcoms are a popular form of entertainment . it is just that movie goers usually expect a more substantial gift . they want their presents trimmed with more involving characters and with a director with a keener eye for humor . looking on the good side of penny marshall's gift to us , the preacher's wife is a good spirited movie even if it is terminally lightweight . here his performance is reduced to smiling a lot . he gives the least believable and most uninteresting characterization in the film . vance is a much better actor than his work here demonstrates . denzel washington's talent manages to shine through marshall's overly mellow approach . houston's specialty , as illustrated by her work in the bodyguard , is to provide the foundation about which the other stars build the movie . kevin costner provided the interest in the bodyguard , and houston's character was little more than focal point for the story line . the script gives houston some good lines , but she is not convincing . the sets and the costumes for the movie pose a problem . although the meantime between laughs is longer than it should be , the picture does have its moments . this well-worn bible of religious canons has a page with the microsoft windows logo so that the angels can recognize mankind's key secular insignia . the silicon valley audience at the press screening laughed harder at this scene than any other . more typical of the humor is the repartee among the leads . in a christmas movie season that glorifies finding a turboman action figure for your son because "" whoever doesn't is going to be a real loser , "" the story here comes to a refreshingly different resolution . this concluding aspect of the movie pushed me over the edge into being able to recommend what is otherwise a lame comedy and a lightweight remake . the preacher's wife runs about 1 : 45 i think , but the press kit does not give the time . there are two uses of the word hell as an expletive that push the rating from g to pg . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or other profanity . the movie can be seen by the whole family , but the slowness of the pacing will probably lose the interest of those under eight . i give the film a marginal thumbs up and a rating of * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6

"" all-in-all , there are something like fifteen numbers , with almost every major member of the cast getting an opportunity to warble at least one line . with everyone says i love you , allen is paying homage to the way musicals used to be made , back in the era when stars who didn't have great voices were occasionally forced to sing . here , it doesn't always result in the sort of track you'll want on a cd , but it's nice to know that sung lines are not being dubbed , and allen himself doesn't suddenly sound like elton john when he breaks into song . yes , it's almost painful to endure julia roberts' single number , but it's hard not to respect her for trying , or allen for giving her the chance . the plot , which centers loosely around one sprawling , extended family , is extremely complicated , primarily because there are so many characters . for most of the film , allen makes effective use of his ensemble cast ; only near the end does the crowd of people vying for screen time turn into a detriment . that's not a surprise , however , considering that the last fifteen minutes of the movie are its weakest , in spite of a wonderful song-and-dance number featuring allen and a feather-light goldie hawn ( who can sing ) . when it comes to humor , everyone says i love you is right up there with two of allen's better , recent comic releases , manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway . like those films , everyone says i love you is overflowing with genuinely funny moments that span the spectrum from physical comedy to sly , sophisticated wit . allen gets in a number of terrific one-liners , none of which i'll reveal here . his comic sense extends to the musical numbers , many of which are done tongue-in-cheek . one area where everyone says i love you falls a little short is in its observations about the human condition . everyone says i love you is surprisingly shallow in that regard , going for numerous , broad generalizations rather than depth . again , perhaps this is the result of having so many stories to tell . roberts is luminous . roth is a hoot . alda and hawn make for a pleasant , albeit slightly off-kilter couple . and allen , as always , is allen . even drew barrymore , playing very much against her sex kitten type , is effective . it's difficult not to be impressed by what allen has achieved with this film : successfully reviving the musical comedy in such a thoroughly delightful fashion . the production may be uneven , but it's still wonderful to behold , even at the end , when the structure frays around the edges . of course , the real force that makes everyone says i love you work is allen himself . and , in doing so , he gives us a movie that is recognizable as both "" a woody allen film "" and something refreshingly different .",0.8
"screenplay : chris mcquarrie , bryan singer and michael feit dougan . director : bryan singer . public access is an ambitious , stylish film that manages to find itself both inches from brilliance and inches from complete impenitrability . it's a dark tale of family values gone awry , and manages to establish an effective tone of simmering menace . the problems really begin when that simmer should be turning into a boil . the first half of public access is thoroughly intriguing , introducing whiley in a manner that makes it clear that something about him is not quite right , but keeps you guessing as to what exactly it is . as long as whiley remains a mystery , public access is a gripping drama . what were whiley's motivations , or do they even matter ? a climactic confrontation between whiley and a vocal critic was disappointingly short on tension , and the pivotal montage which brings the film to a close seems so deliberately opaque that it's just off-putting . viewers of public access will likely find immediate similarities to david lynch's blue velvet . director and co-writer bryan singer seems not at all shy about paying homage to influences like lynch , alan parker and the coen brothers . unfortunately , he never quite combines all these elements into a style all his own . the interjection of a couple of eccentric public access programs is jarring , and leads the viewer to believe that public access is going to be * about * cable television , which it absolutely is not . nothing in singer's direction really stands out except lingering shots of a ceiling fan and a glass of water which scream "" meaningful .

"starring : peter coyote , emmanuelle seigner , hugh grant , kristin scott-thomas director : roman polanski producer : roman polanski screenplay : roman polanski , gerard brach , and john brownjohn based on lunes de fiel by pascal bruckner music : vangelis released by fine line features roman polanski has never done anything conventional . bitter moon , polanski's newest effort , represents a nadir . this is bad melodrama , complete with hammy acting and purple prose , and far too long to be even passingly entertaining . it's soap opera quality , from beginning to sensationalistic end . thematically , however , bitter moon , with its failed attempts to delve into the issue of sexual repression , has more in common with another recent hugh grant offering--sirens . it's a weakness of bitter moon that the explosive ending seems cheap and contrived rather than the natural wrap to a series of events . one of the main problems is that the shipboard plot drifts around without a suitable anchor . the characters of nigel and fiona have as much substance as shadows , and their interactions with mimi and oscar are forced and unnatural . the finale , if examined closely , doesn't make a whole lot of sense . the flashback sequences , which constitute two-thirds of the movie's screen time , are moderately more compelling , but they take far too much time . the pendulum-like swing of the dynamic between oscar and mimi--from obsession and love to dependence and hatred--is fascinating as a concept , but polanski's translation of it from written page is awkward and plodding . the limits of actress emmanuelle seigner may be part of the problem . she's seductive and sexy , but has a tendency to overact even the smallest scenes . peter coyote manages to be too much of the cliched american , but this is more the fault of the writing than his acting . that this is intentional because of the nature of oscar ( he's supposed to be a frustrated , second-rate author ) makes little difference--such dime-store prose is distracting and annoying . need i say more ? certain scenes approach the levels of soft-core pornography with seemingly little purpose other than to titillate or shock various segments of the audience . the opposite of repression may be awareness and acceptance , but it doesn't require an explicit recounting of sexual antics to get the point across . do we really need to see peter coyote cavorting around on all fours in a pig mask and nothing else ? ( actually , that was one of the movie's funnier moments . ) i'm not sure what audience polanski aimed this movie at , but i'm obviously not in the target group . once the overly-long narrative had concluded , i felt nothing but apathy for the characters , themes , and situations presented therein .",0.47

"even though it takes place in the 90s , the atmosphere is pure 40s . the dialogue by hilary henkin could have been lifted from any dime store detective story , and it's almost a surprise to see gary oldman sauntering around instead of , say , humphrey bogart . but romeo is bleeding isn't just an homage to the genre , it's a satire as well . unfortunately , it has a tendency to take itself too seriously , which greatly limits its effectiveness . then there's the dialogue , which includes some of the following "" classic "" lines : "" can i tell you what makes love frightening ? it's that you don't own it ; it owns you "" , "" whoever you shoot , you might as well marry , because you're tied together with them until the end of life . to the end of either their life , or yours "" , and "" a life's a life--moral distinctions can paralyze you . "" the atmosphere is black-and-white , even though the movie is in color . dariusz wolski's camerawork is evocative , as is the angelo badalamenti-like score by mark isham . unfortunately , the production runs into problems almost from the outset . while gary oldman is an excellent actor , either he's not right for this part , or he's not playing it the way it was meant to be played . his portrayal is unrelentingly grim , which effectively nullifies much of the satirical bent of romeo is bleeding . not only is jack grimaldi unlikable , but he's boring , and certainly not a match for the villainess . lena olin gets the kind of over-the-top , totally nasty role that is normally given to a male actor . her mona demarkov makes sharon stone's basic instinct character look like a girl scout . she's the kind of woman that will laugh while garroting you , take a chainsaw to her own arm , then ask if you want to make love with the prosthesis on or off . ms . olin steals every scene that she's in , although that isn't difficult considering how easily mr . oldman blends into the background . juliette lewis is , plainly put , annoying in what is thankfully a small role . anabella sciorra fares much better as the wife whom grimaldi professes to still love . the voice-over is another problem . it's certainly hardboiled , which is in keeping with the overall tone , but it's also incredibly long-winded and intrusive . it doesn't take long before the viewer begins to wish mr . oldman would just shut up and let the story get moving on its own . comparisons with quentin tarantino's reservoir dogs and true romance are inevitable , but romeo is bleeding comes across as an inferior product . tarantino may operate in the same genre , and with equally bloody scripts , but his characters have greater depth and his stories are more energetic and powerful . without lena olin's performance , romeo is bleeding could have been an ordinary , or even sub-par , film noir . however , with a villainess as fun as mona demarkov , it's impossible not to find some enjoyment amidst gary oldman's dreadful seriousness and all the bloody corpses . there are some plot twists , and a few unexpected happenings , but in the end , it's ms . olin's character that keeps the audience in their seats .",0.59
"this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination . hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign . yet the monster remains a sympathetic figure . it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark . it offered better entertainment value than most big-budget sci-fi films .",0.6
"writer and director gary ross , the writer and creator of big and dave , delights audiences once again with his best fantasy ever in pleasantville . like most teens , they blow all of this off , worrying more about their own popularity at school than the issues of the day . reese witherspoon delivers a dead-on performance as a sarcastic teen , who is aghast to be thrown into the plastic 1950s . the whole first half of the movie , as the kids cope and alter their new environment , is comedy at its best . intelligently written , the film's first part produces such a stream of laughter that you may need a second viewing to catch all the spoken humor and sight gags . breakfast , which is in danger of touching the ceiling , consists of stacks of dozens of pancakes , waffles , and toast . everything , absolutely everything , has always gone perfectly in pleasantville . like most television facades , there are a few things missing , like toilets in the bathroom stalls and words in the books , but the townsfolk don't mind . the movie explores change through the power of reading as well as sex . it is too bad that pleasantville had to come out the same year as the truman show since they will inevitably be compared . next to an almost perfect film like the truman show , pleasantville isn't as quite as good , having many fewer memorable lines for one and lacking the talent of a jim carrey for another , but this should not be allowed to detract from the incredible brilliance of pleasantville . as dazzlingly filmed by john lindley in a gorgeous black and white , the movie slowly develops color in small places like roses and tongues , until it bursts into a bouquet of saturated colors by the end . how and why things turn color is one of the mysteries that the story slowly reveals . at first the reason seems simple and almost trite , and then the complete rationale behind the colorization becomes the story's key turning point . visually it is a stunning technical achievement . once color appears in this innovative film , women's make-up is shown to be able to take on an entirely different role . starting as a hilarious comedy , the story transforms carefully into a serious satire on life's insanities . although it starts off as a romp , the film ends up with more messages than you can count , all of them delivered delicately but powerfully . part science fiction , the story asks the age-old question of what would happen to the future if you could alter the past ? moreover , would the results be what you expect and want ? david worries about this a lot , but jennifer is more interested in freeing the people from their chains and the consequences be damned . the movie contains many great small performances . the story has many surprises . you yell "" cat !

"in the spirit of full disclosure , let me admit upfront that i am from the beach boys generation . not only do i never listen to heavy metal , punk , or grunge music , i haven't listened to anything but classical for years . given these facts i am one of the least likely people on this planet to be recommending a documentary about the grunge movement in seattle . nevertheless , this review will do precisely that . first time director doug pray creates an accessible documentary film , hype ! , about the birth of grunge in seattle . it is an absolutely riveting film with broad appeal although given the subject , it may only be seen by a niche audience . if so , a lot of viewers are going to miss out on something well worth seeing . . . . this is all part of what goes into the music . . . . as the talking heads are speaking , deft editors doug pray and joan zapata intersperse video clips of the northwest's majestic beauty and absolute squalor . once the background is laid , the groups are shown in performance , but this is most assuredly not a rock video . the clips are short and used to illustrate the points . their shtick of hoping around like kangaroos and jumping into their instruments and into their audience as much from exuberance as showmanship . as you watch them , their joy becomes quite infectious . this is a high energy , very upbeat show . if it has a single message , it might be that this music is pure unadulterated fun . certainly the film is quite humorous and never pedantic . second , the groups are not all the stereotypes you may believe . if the word grunge makes you think of a bunch of white males with long unkempt hair and needle pitted arms , think again . moreover , some of the members look more like nerds than rock stars . as van conner of screaming trees puts it , "" we were the guys in high school who couldn't even talk to the pretty girls . the show attempts to be a bit educational . this excerpt appears on the trailer so i've seen the clip fours times now , and i still can ascertain no difference which , i suppose , is the point . grunge is minimalist music . it is the energy of its players that breathes life into it . for a documentary , the camera work by robert bennett is surprising good . it says in the press kit that the film is done without "" any narration or voice-over commentary . "" this is done so that there would be "" no outside pundit . "" all of this gives the film a clarity that lets us eavesdrop without being noticed . the working title of the film was the fabulous sounds of the pacific northwest , but was changed to hype ! the best appears as fact in a new york times article that purports to give an up-to-date lexicon of grunge . although the movement's costumes are low rent , the fashion designers see them as an opportunity to turn them into something to make big profits . we have scenes of grunge outfits displayed on the marbled floors of exclusive shopping emporiums . similarly , the rock music publishing world wanted to write about nothing but grunge . my favorite article they show is the one headlined : "" honey , i blew up the amp . "" for a documentary that interviews three dozen people , it still manages to make all of them compelling . somehow you feel you get to know all of them in a short amount of time . many fictional films can't accomplish this with just a few stars . i ended up liking and caring about most of them . a fascinating group . although i'd still never buy any of their records , i loved watching their antics as they performed , and i loved listening to them talk . make a noise and play music your parents won't like . "" hype ! runs just 1 : 24 . it was not rated at the time of the press screening , but i see no reason why it shouldn't get a pg rating . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . there may have been some bad language , but i didn't remember any . the film would be fine for anybody , but i am sure it would hold no interest for younger kids . the best documentaries , and this is one , take you into worlds you have never been or ever wanted to go and let you live there vicariously . i enjoyed my voyage into the world of grunge , and i think you would too so i am recommending the film and giving it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7
"all right , that might be a slight exaggeration ; i have some ideas about that life after death thing . reeves remains a mystery , a physically striking but mush-mouthed thespian who has been cast by coppola , bertolucci and branagh . arriving with more buzz than a swarm of killer bees is speed , and you can believe the hype . thrilling and relentless to a fault , speed seems destined to score big box office and make reeves a very hot property . as high concepts go , speed would have been difficult to screw up completely . where i had my doubts was regarding the ability to keep things varied and interesting ; there are only so many ways a bus can crash through guardrails and other cars . but astonishingly , speed continues to come up with new and interesting predicaments just when you think there can't be anywhere else for it to go . screenwriter graham yost and director jan debont almost give themselves too tough an act to follow by opening with the elevator rescue , a stunningly staged sequence that will leave you breathless before you're even out of popcorn . once the action hits the road , the set pieces come fast , furious and rarely derivative . there is even that rarity of rarities , a moment that inspires a collective audible gasp , followed closely by relieved laughter . the term "" edge of your seat "" is thrown around a lot , but that is exactly where i spent the majority of speed's two hour running time . he is asked to do little more than set his jaw and look good in a tight t-shirt , and he's good at both . the taciturn traven is a switch from the willis/ schwarzenegger school of one-liner heroism , and something of a welcome one at that . with reeves maintaining a poker face , the required tension release falls to the supporting cast . sandra bullock , so annoying as stallone's partner in demolition man , is extremely appealing as driver/passenger annie , managing to combine strength and emotion in a surprisingly seamless performance . the performances are better than one might expect from a film like speed , and from keanu reeves in particular . if there is a fault to be found with speed , it's that it really doesn't know when enough is enough . the bus's physics defying leap over a stretch of incomplete freeway is more comically absurd than exciting , and almost lost me . once the bus-based plot is over , there's still another fifteen minutes to go , and perhaps out of some sense of houw an action film has to end there is a mano-a-mano between reeves and hopper aboard a commuter train . at that point , yet another set of improbable crises becomes overkill . and ironically , it may have eliminated one possible plot for the sequel . don't be surprised if there is one ; speed is 1994's the fugitive , and then some . summer's first thrill ride is here .",0.9

"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . first , this important preface : i love wings of desire . wim wenders' lyrical 1988 film , positing angels roaming through berlin and one particular angel fascinated with the human experience , caught me completely by surprise when i first saw it . it was less a narrative than a visual tone poem of division -- between heaven and earth , between monochrome and color , between east and west berlin -- which eventually finds unity . the experience , terribly un-critic-like though it may sound , was spiritually moving . that emotional response contributed significantly to me distaste for wenders' own ill-fated attempt at a sequel , faraway , so close ! ; it similarly led me to dread the impending arrival of the americanized re-make city of angels . why re-make perfection , especially to engage in the typical hollywood reductionism of making it all about the love story between the curious angel and his human object of desire ? perhaps it is because i expected so little that i was so improbably delighted by city of angels . though the decision to play up that relationship was certainly a practical one -- wings of desire's stream-of-consciousness eavesdropping hardly screams "" commercial "" -- it also gives city of angels its unique identity . the result is sort of a strange cousin to rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead -- a story based on existing characters and situations , yet thematically independent and appealing in its own right . much of that appeal springs from city of angels' commitment to its tone . few mainstream hollywood movies of recent years have been so willing to adopt a reflective pace , to paint broad canvases of human experience and allow us to watch in peace . while never earth-shaking , silberling's compositions are rarely predictable and frequently memorable . it's that rare big-screen movie that uses the big screen , allowing its intimate story to unfold in the grandeur of a massive city . ultimately , it's that intimate story which will win over viewers . cage and ryan make a superb romantic pair , each actor reaching for the longing in their respective characters and connecting that longing to the other . though cage may not be the most obvious choice for a role based on preternatural calm , the intensity percolating beneath his benevolent glances heightens the anticipation of his possible "" fall "" to humanity . few quibbles about the characters matter , however , when they share the screen ; the sheer force of their eye contact is often enough to wipe away any doubts about their feelings . a story about life-changing emotion is a hard sell to cynical audiences , but cage and ryan sell it . for all its meaphysical musings , there's never any question that city of angels is an old-style hollywood love story , a multi-hanky weeper light years removed from the dream-like wings of desire . it's almost enough to make you forget that angels is based on wings . . . which , for my money , is the best thing that possibly could have happened . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.8
"another summer , another double-dip of disaster dramas . this time around , instead of volcanoes , it's comets . deep impact focuses more on the earth- based sitting ducks than on the would-be astronaut heroes . ( armageddon is not near the top of my "" must see "" list -- after mercury rising , i've had enough of willis for the year . ) by their very nature , disaster movies tend to be mediocre ( at best ) . going into deep impact , my primary reason for optimism was the recognition that the cast is loaded ( robert duvall , vanessa redgrave , maximilian schell , morgan freeman , james cromwell ) . i mean , how bad can a movie be with names like that ? unfortunately , an a-list group of actors doesn't mean a lot when there isn't much of a script . somewhere within deep impact , there's a worthwhile story struggling to get out . sadly , it never emerges , and what we're saddled with is a poorly concentrated tale that builds "" drama "" by using an avalanche of clich ? s . one of the most obvious problems with deep impact is that there are too many characters , each with too little personality . consequently , none of the characters are given the opportunity to become real or important to us . in titanic , which is essentially a disaster movie with a romance tacked on , james cameron had the right idea : focus on a few , select individuals . had deep impact taken this approach , it might have been more gripping . as it is , the viewer sits patiently in his or her seat , enduring all sorts of perfunctory , "" character building "" moments while waiting for the special effects show to begin . since this is a disaster movie , some sort of cataclysm is expected , and , in that , deep impact does not disappoint . while the special effects sequences are not eye-popping , they generate a certain visceral satisfaction . and , although a huge tidal wave bearing down on the united states' east coast looks computer generated , it's impressive nonetheless . still , the catastrophe passes a little too quickly , and it fails to generate the kind of awe that the film makers were striving for . the science in deep impact is adequate for a big-budget summer flick , but hardly flawless . this is director mimi leder's follow-up to the peacemaker , and it's not a great deal more successful . the same basic problem is evident : she has the actors , the visual effects , the camerawork , and the technical know-how , but all of that can't cover up the fundamental weakness of a flawed , inadequate screenplay . at times , i felt like i was watching a stripped-down version of independence day , minus the aliens and the charm of will smith and jeff goldblum . deep impact has a bushel of good actors , but they're all on hand to pick up paychecks . in fact , several key players -- namely vanessa redgrave , maximilian schell , and james cromwell -- are seriously underused . the emotional cornerstone of the film is intended to be tea leoni ( flirting with disaster ) , but , as perky and appealing as the actress can be , her character is so sketchily developed that it's difficult to identify with her . in the end , it all comes down to caring about the characters and their circumstances , and i didn't . we're given glimpses of possibilities , but nothing is developed , and that makes it all the more frustrating . it all turns into background noise in the lives of about a dozen two-dimensional , stock characters . needless to say , the movie isn't as profound as the title suggests . in fact , when considering the impact of leder's film , the word "" shallow "" leaps to mind far more readily than "" deep .

"love and other catastrophes is one of those movies that's so light and airy that's it's almost impossible to hate . unfortunately , it's also terribly predictable , which makes it difficult to like . in addition , the film tries so hard to be hip and trendy that at times it's almost painful . put that all together and what you get is a pleasant- but-dissatisfying motion picture that seems to be trying to copy cameron crowe's singles , but ends up a lot closer to ben stiller's reality bites . love and other catastrophes is the most recent in a veritable flood of comedies from australia . at least this one is a little different in temperament and style . for one thing , the soundtrack isn't saturated with '70s songs ( nothing by abba is even hinted at ) . secondly , few of the actors will look familiar . in fact , for many of them , like for director/co-writer emma-kate croghan , this is their first feature . love and other catastrophes falls into the category of the singularly unambitious romantic comedy . too many of the jokes fall flat , including brief jabs at the fanatical followers of directors quentin tarantino , woody allen , and spike lee . the film has a little fun equating the wisdom of philosophers like nietzche with that pop icons like john lennon , paul mccartney , and alfred hitchcock . perhaps the best line ( although not necessarily the most appropriate ) is a quote from the famous thriller director : "" always make the audience suffer as much as possible . "" for the most part , the fresh-faced actors , especially francis o'connor and alice garner , give likable performances . unfortunately , there isn't much romantic chemistry in evidence , although it's easy to envision all these characters as platonic friends . there's a simple playfulness about their relationships that's never effectively transformed into heat , even though we have a pretty good idea from the beginning who's going to be paired up with whom . the best part of love and other catastrophes has nothing to do with romance or relationships . this sequence is about the only spontaneous-seeming aspect of the film ; the rest of love and other catastrophes is at least a notch below it . i suppose croghan thought she was bringing something new to the screen with love and other catastrophes , although i can't imagine what . admittedly , this is the first generation x comedy that i can recall being photographed through an amber filter , but i don't think that's what the director had in mind for her hallmark achievement . unfortunately , that's one of the most memorable aspects of this unremarkable film . love and other catastrophes isn't funny enough , romantic enough , or offbeat enough to distinguish itself from the many films it's in direct competition with .",0.6
"david webb peoples has contributed to some of the most compelling screenplays of recent years . peoples has shown a facility for turning genre films into films of ideas . the specific ideas with which he has concerned himself held out the hope that soldier might be something more than this week's disposable bit of whoop-it-up mayhem . i suspect that peoples's original script focused on how the functionally anti-social todd begins to explore human interaction for the first time . that's not the story director paul anderson insists on telling . though in his production notes anderson describes the story as "" shane in outer space , "" he actually makes it much more like rambo in outer space . the final half-hour generally finds todd picking off his faceless adversaries like red-shirts in a "" star trek "" episode , occasionally interrupted by immense explosions and flying bodies . never mind that caine is a programmed soldier just like todd himself , and that it would be much more interesting to sympathize with him than to cheer his inevitable defeat mindlessly . there's nothing inherently wrong with black hat/white hat action adventures where we watch a bit of carnage and root for good to triumph over evil . the problem is that anderson pretends soldier is more than that , offering scenes of todd perplexed by a tear rolling down his face , or recoiling at displays of kindness . moments that might have been genuinely affecting instead inspire derisive laughter , because anderson is far more interested in visceral response than in emotional response . ironically , he spends most of the film reveling in dehumanizing violence instead of showing how dehumanizing violence created his protagonist . i can't believe that's the story david webb peoples wanted to tell , which is what makes soldier more disappointing than it might otherwise be . he turned over a smart idea to a director determined to make a dumb movie . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.4
"it is adapted from a semi-autobiographical book written as a teenager in the '50s , for a national literary contest , by john kennedy toole . when this slow-moving film works , and it often does , it is artistically and subtly satisfying to behold , as it spins its simple story in flashback . all this drama is played out quietly . the the film ends abruptly and magnificently , without a summation of what might happen to david . how this child grew up during that period of transitional southern history , in a climate of racial bigotry and christian hypocrisy , in a family with obvious economic , psychological , and cultural problems , sets the mood for this dramatic story . the cinematography was beautifully done . gena rowlands was impressive in a very subtle performance . jacob tierney as david , gave his character softness and breath in a laconic performance . the only problem i have with his performance , is that since this is his life story being told , he seems to be too emotionless . i found that hard to fathom ; if it was me on that nighttime train , alone , going to who knows where , as my brief life passes before me , i would have certainly been more animated about the situation i was in . this film is not davies' best film , it was too dull at times for that ; but , it is a solid film , an honestly done effort that was well-researched and presented . it offered an interesting observation about the rural south , that is often filmed , but most of the time , it is done with less tact than how it was done here and with less of a real artistic touch .",0.6
"as you were enjoying your last woody allen movie , did you sit there thinking that his angst-filled , raunchy brand of humor would be perfect for all ages if his language was just cleaned up a bit and he was made into a cartoon character ? if so , then you are part of the target audience for antz , since that is exactly what dreamworks has created . who else might possibly be members of the target audience is the big question . in our packed screening , the kids fidgeted , laughing only at the cuss words , the adults enjoyed a few tidbits tossed their way , but , overall , it was one of the deadest early screenings for a major motion picture that i've ever attended . personally , i sat there in stone silent disbelief , wondering what the studio thought they were doing . take pixar's marvelously innovative toy story , drain off most of the humor and darken the film's look and tone , and , voila , you have dreamworks's antz . z , the film's hero , is a non-conformist who ends up inciting trouble in the ranks . the dreadfully dull script , full of droll but laughless humor , is by todd alcott , chris weitz and paul weitz . the talky script has few memorable lines . z argues , in of the few good lines , as a better approach than a war with the termites . ) woody's voice is emotive , but the rest of the voices came across as flat and uninteresting . like pixar's toy story , the film is created with computer generated images , but few of those in antz are impressive . a scene with a water drop and another at a picnic show off the new medium at its best , but the rest of the work remains fairly pedestrian . the eyes of the characters , for example , look like glass eyes , and the film is usually so dimly lit that it frequently looks murky . although the target audience is questionable , certainly a lot of kids will to flock to see the movie . given this , why can't they be served up something more involving than a few mild obscenities to tickle their funny bones ? why do we have characters who talk about "" erotic fantasies "" and who tell others to "" bite me !

"a poorly done documentary that is superficially entertaining , whose blurred camerawork , its failure to get hold of its subject in anything but a self-promoting manner , and its campy playing with the criminal scandals and lawsuits that became front-page news fraught with sex charges and fraud in fund-raising is done in a witless manner , which leaves me scratching my worldly head about why this farcical film was made or why it thinks this would make tammy faye , the subject of the film , look better than the national joke she is . the only thing this film clearly revealed about tammy faye , is that she loves to be in front of the camera , is terribly vain , is addicted to diet-coke , wears tons of makeup and wears her emotions on her sleeve , mistakeningly thinking she's an old-fashioned girl who likes real things when we clearly see otherwise ; and most importantly , she wears loreal mascara and has permanently false eyebrows ( which is her trademark ) , and that her lips are permanently lined . since i didn't care about her when she was riding high in the 1960s and 1970s and early 1980s , and i didn't care about her when she was banished from christian tv because of her disgrace , i wondered what this documentary would present that would change my mind about her , so i at least could care somewhat about her . but it failed to get me to see her in any other light than that of a self-absorbed publicity hound and someone who is superficial to the point of being a caricature of someone who is superficial , though if she is compared to those other christian hypocrites -- like her ex-husband jim bakker , jerry falwell , and pat robinson , she passes the likability test with flying colors . the film's aim seems to be nothing less than a rehabilitation project in the public image on tammy faye messner , the once queen of televangelism but the now exile in the world of christian televangelism . this reasoning on her part does not wash with me . rupaul charles does the narration , honing in solely on tammy's point of view . we don't know much more about jim bakker from this work , other than a few trivial crumbs of polished gloss tammy throws our way . i didn't buy into her act and i didn't find the film funny , when it should have been both a scream and a much more informative piece than what was presented . but if one has such low expections of tammy , as i surmise most do who are out of range of her choir , then some of those might find that she is more likable than they first thought . but don't include me as one her converts . i came away with the same trashy opinion of her i had before i saw this "" mock "" documentary . he might be right , i'm sure she'll even survive this movie about her .",0.3

"this extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter , as the camera is held steadfast , not moving for insatiably long periods of time , picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion , as it looks at an oregon lumber mill , whose owner ( tom blair ) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life . by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered . this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome . this is one of jost's deepest and most penetrating films , it could even be argued that he has made a classical film , as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story , replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting , that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature , that becomes a part of the people's own nature . one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film . this time consuming shot , is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot . this is one of jost's strong points , his willingness to explore territory others fear to go . jost's film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn't clarify more precisely , but more importantly , it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with , as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world , as it asks . . . but , what does this mean if americans are not a happy people ?",0.8
"i can think of three reasons why howie long will likely never be a major action star : his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual . unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . - ingmar bergman",0.3
"never has poverty looked more inviting than in wim wenders's buena vista social club . a documentary about cuban music , it's also a homage to the people of havana and to havana itself . shot on digital video with heavily oversaturated colors , the movie shows off the city's radiant beauty to maximum effect . dilapidated buildings with peeling paint are made so appealing that they look like paul gauguin paintings . the cars , being all pre-castro american , make the movie feel like something between a time warp and a classic auto show . the real attraction of the movie , however , is its concert footage , introducing most of us to music that we've heard little of before . with haunting rhythms and soulful lyrics , the heartfelt songs strike an emotional chord deep within our psyche . from the very first note , the music grabs the audience with a visceral intensity and never lets go . in its heyday , all of the best bands played at the "" buena vista social club "" in havana . the movie includes music from many of these groups . the film argues convincingly that this was their last concert together . whenever the energetic music plays , the film is sublime . songs of love are among the most popular , but there are other playful ones as well . then , again , perhaps this song was meant to be understood in metaphor . the movie bogs down only when the music stops . one piece of advice to filmgoers . when you are ready to experience this good-spirited and infectiously happy musical documentary , choose your theater carefully . only ones with adequate legroom will do . no matter how hard you try , your feet will prove uncontrollable from the moment the music starts . there is no need to punish them by confining them to a tight enclosure . finally , a suggestion to theater owners . this will be the easiest sell you will ever make . the film has spanish dialog and songs , both with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be a g as there is nothing to offend anyone of any age .",0.7
"this social comedy is a slick sick one , told in short sketches , where absurdity and perversity go hand-in-hand with the dress , which is the subject of the film . the fashion designer of this plain summer dress is a pervert with a pig fetish , and to add insult to injury , it is worn by losers who are taken in by its optimistic design and colors . on the dresses journey , it brought bad luck to whomever owned it , passing to different ownership many times ; the film could have gone on ad infinitum , if the director wasn't kind enough to end the film with a good old mercy killing of it . but by making it just an object , giving it no other symbolic significance , the film has to rely on its biting satiric humor to carry it through . and since , i couldn't find myself consistently laughing at its monthy python-like skits , nor find its outrageous humor and politically incorrect stands to be paricularly tasteful , i therefore found myself under-whelmed with this third film by the independent cult film director , even as i empathize with his determination to make his own type of film , no matter how it is perceived by others . this bawdy comedy , should guarantee it some audience abroad , though those seeing it in the netherlands , have an added plus going for them , as they should be more able to recognize the cameos that some of the notable dutch film stars make in it . this was the most risque and politically incorrect scene in the film , but it also turned out to be a rather tame but funny scene , after all . but the humor came at the expense of the pathetic lady being chased by the rapist , who when in trouble would shout out , "" i'm normal . "" this rape scene was crasser than the other one , for a few moments it had the same hard edge of violence to it that a film like "" funny games "" had . since i was not all that amused by what i saw and did not find the film particularly perceptive , and only found parts of the film to be diverting and original , it is hard for me to recommend it as anything but an attempt to be outrageously funny without enough substance in it to be funny for a long enough period of time to be a fully entertaining movie . and it is only from an entertainment perspective , i think , that this film should be judged .",0.4
"it astonishes me that two films with essentially the same story can be of such different quality . henri-georges clouzot's 1955 murder mystery , diabolique , was a taut , atmosphere-saturated thriller filled with unexpected twists and turns . jeremiah chechik's ill-advised rip- off is a lame hollywood attempt to re-create a similarly suspenseful experience . i suppose it's possible to argue that , because clouzot's picture was made over forty years ago , a remake isn't unreasonable . the problem is , the original diabolique was as much a cinematic landmark as hitchcock's psycho ( clouzot and hitchcock had a tremendous influence on each other ) . one should not undertake remaking a great film lightly , if at all . unfortunately , in this case , "" integrity "" wasn't a concept the film makers were concerned with . modernizing diabolique also means adding some exploitative elements . isabelle adjani disrobes early in the film for no apparent reason other than to give viewers a chance to ogle her . there's also a steamy sex scene featuring nicole and guy that serves no purpose -- we already know that the two are lovers . as was the case with the american rendition of the vanishing , the film makers here have decided to change the ending . gone is the deliciously diabolical finale of clouzot's picture , replaced by something that's unambiguous , unambitious , and manifestly unoriginal . don roos' routine conclusion is the kind of massive cop-out likely to disappoint anyone hoping for something fresh . isabelle adjani gives a horrible performance , overacting almost every scene . there were instances when her expressions of speechless horror reminded me of fay wray's exaggerated reaction to king kong ( albeit without the screams ) . sharon stone and chazz palminteri are barely adequate as cartoon-like characters , displaying little range in one-dimensional roles . the only one who does anything with her part is kathy bates , but her energetic portrayal as a cynical detective is largely wasted . everything seems to be wrong with this version of diabolique . the acting is subpar , the direction is pedestrian , and the screenplay is moronic . certain lines are laughably bad ( "" it's not like you burnt the toast , mia . the cinematographer has unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the original's eerie , black-and-white atmosphere by using everything from inappropriately-placed shadows to foggy rainstorms . little about this diabolique is worthwhile , and nothing is laudable . my advice is to ignore the remake and rent the original .",0.35

"both are completely believable and deliver strong performances , but carrillo steals the movie in a long dramatic scene towards the end . although it is a powerful film at times , loach makes two strategic mistakes that significantly and needlessly detract from its message . brody , a tom green look-alike who darts around like harpo marx , gives the movie a comedic side that is jarringly out of place with the rest of the drama . the second mistake concerns the subtitles . since the characters would naturally speak a mixture of english and spanish , loach keeps switching the language that is being subtitled . in theory this may sound sensible , but in practice it is a disaster . if you try to read the subtitles and they turn out to be in a language you don't understand , then , by the time you stop reading and start listening , you've missed the first few words of the sentence and are frequently unable to parse what is being said . the reverse is true if you're listening carefully , only to realize that you should have been reading . since these switches may occur several times per minute , it is hard to keep track of the dialog . if loach felt that dual language subtitling were necessary , there are two ways that would have solved the problem . either have both languages subtitled all of the time -- films shown in multilingual countries like switzerland do this -- or use different colors with , say , white for english and yellow for spanish . bread and roses makes some powerful points for the union while reminding us of everyone's believe in self-reliance . were it not for the miscasting of the comical adrien brody in a serious part and for the distracting and constant switching of subtitles , i would have been able to recommend bread and roses . it is rated r for strong language and brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",0.6

"" that one line says as much about his character as it does the intentions of this motion picture . max isn't particularly likable , but we feel for him nonetheless . he gives us a max that we aren't likely to identify with , but who doesn't promote audience apathy , either . isabella rossellini is not as effective as laura - she doesn't always have the best grip on her character - but her part doesn't demand the same level of intensity . for the most part , perez's acting is understated , which makes sudden bursts of emotion all the more forceful . not only in hulce totally unconvincing , but this particular element of the story is pointless and distracting . john turturro doesn't fare much better . i never accepted him as a therapist , and his presence adds little to fearless . the theatrical trailers for this movie would lead you to believe that it's an uplifting experience . nothing could be further from the truth . while there are a few moments of emotional exultation , most of the movie explores darker elements of human nature . the score , by maurice jarre , is suitably eerie at all the right times . there is no grand fanfare or devastating crescendo during the crash sequences . instead , we get an unearthly , almost-silent theme that seems to slow down the action , lending added impact to the tragedy . great care is taken to show the hero worship exhibited by the boy who followed max out of the plane , but beyond the setup , little is done . there is so much untapped potential here that it seems a crime for director peter weir to give it such cursory treatment . fearless is an impressive film even considering the untapped potential . the interactions of the three main characters are potent without being shocking or sensationalistic ( especially those between max and carla ) , and the import of the questions raised isn't diminished because of the lack of firm answers . the final scene is a fitting , if highly-symbolic , conclusion to all that goes before it , and should provide fodder for post-movie conversations and/or reflections . fearless is not a film that you walk away from and immediately forget .",0.82
"it could be almost like a documentary that someone like espn would do , such as there 'when baseball was a game , ' but in this depression-era nostalgia piece about a genuine jewish baseball superstar -- supposedly , the first one who openly said he was jewish and wouldn't change his name -- the game becomes much more than what it is . it becomes a look at the social and political climate of america just as much as a baseball biography . it would drive in . it was as if hank was passing the baton to jackie . there is no doubt about it , hank was an inspiration to many people who needed such a heroic figure . this film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone era , doing it in an effortlessly grand style , with a tongue-in-cheek humor . besides , any film that has a clip of the marx brothers breaking up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game , has a good idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the slurs hank had to go through . hank was a class act , never openly complaining about what he went through , just talking about it because that was the real way it was . the only fault of the film , was that the director became too close to his subject , and perhaps , overdramatized the effects of greenberg . the conclusion of ww11 also had a lot to do with the change of america's attitude , though it is doubtful if anti-semitism is through for good , as there are still other barriers in america that have to be broken down , such as having a jewish president .",0.6
"too many movies these days aren't smart enough to realize they would have been infinitely better recast as parodies - firestorm and hard rain come immediately to mind . arguably the best thing that can be said about the big hit is that it is smart enough to realize how dumb it is and to make the most of it . never taking itself seriously , even for a moment , the movie features silly dialog ( "" ladies , you're so fine i want to pour milk over you and make you a part of my complete breakfast . "" ) and shoot 'em up action played for maximum camp . cisco and the other members of his crew like to show off their buff bodies , and the picture includes some conspicuous rear male nudity to titillate the audience . taavo soodor's set decoration is a hoot . but this funny subplot is basically unprintable . among the movie's more absurd scenes is a car chase and demolition derby , during which cisco uses his car like paul bunyan to fell the big trees in his path . the movie even uses instant replays to show you exactly how the characters manage to escape certain death . well , lots of bad things do happen in the hit men . and its director kirk wong has the audience laughing at most of them . it is rated r for violence , profanity and brief nudity and would be fine for teenagers .",0.7
"alternatively witty , poignant , insightful and surprising , the film relates the story of a man's life by focusing on its ending , while keeping the flashbacks to a minimum . whale , played with an oscar caliber performance by ian mckellen , was an eccentric and a loner . an avowed homosexual , at a time when few admitted it publicly , whale dropped out of the active hollywood scene . although the choice of fraser to go opposite sir ian may seem a bit odd , it works . comedic actor fraser , who has played serious parts before , as in school ties , makes us expect much less than we get . he gives his character charisma and a subtle complexity . he says , for example , that boris karloff was a proper english actor but was dreadfully dull . the natural chemistry between them doesn't follow conventional patterns . the movie contains old film footage of jimmy's classic movies as well as reconstructions of their shootings . although these form the heart of god and monsters , there are many wonderfully little odd ball incidents as well . typical of these is the obviously gay reporter who doesn't have much respect for jimmy's talents but has come for a pro forma interview of him . based on christopher bram's novel , written and lovingly directed by bill condon , the film touches us with its honest and poignant portrayal of a fascinating individual . it is not rated but would be an r for sex , profanity and mature subject matter and would be fine for older and mature teenagers .",0.8
""" isn't it exciting ? "" you used to complain that nothing happened . "" it is an erotically-charged morality tale with the message that actions have consequences and horrific actions have horrific consequences . is it just for sadomasochistic sexual gratification as it certainly seems ? this is a girl with a very twisted sense of morality . she cries profusely for a rabbit that they run over but has no sense of remorse over slicing up a human being like a piece of meat . filmed beautifully and scored well musically , the picture alternately invites and repulses us . the most sickening scene turns out to be the skinning of a rabbit , as its flesh is ripped off its body . it is the type of movie that , the more you describe it , the more your readers want no part of it . but this is a fascinating film with chillingly believable acting . and with plenty of surprises along the way . suffice it to say that they would have been much better off if the police had found them first . if ever there was a movie that isn't for everyone , it's criminal lovers . but if you find really dark sexual thrillers intriguing , criminal lovers may be the picture for you since they don't get much darker or more erotic than this . it is in french with english subtitles . the film is not rated but would probably be nc-17 for nudity , language and strong sexuality and violence , including rape . it is for adults only .",0.7

"" instead , the most remarkable scenes in the boxer are those that feature danny and maggie engaged in quiet conversation . the two actors , daniel day-lewis and emily watson ( breaking the waves ) , give such forceful performances and interact so well that it's impossible not to be mesmerized by their interaction . and , although the two share plenty of moments together , i wish sheridan had devoted even more screen time to their love story . it is the boxer's anchor . although not as gripping as some mother's son , the boxer is strong enough to overcome its occasional missteps and leave a lasting impression . this may be a work of fiction , but its themes and issues are as real and immediate as those addressed by any contemporary documentary . - ingmar bergman",0.7
"how whimsical and amusing does a film need to be before it ceases to matter that it lacks a center -- not just that its center is slight , but that it has no center whatsoever ? such a question plagued me at the end of saving grace , a comedy with that uniquely british quirky appeal . it was a pleasant enough experience for most of its running time , but what in the world was the point ? there are certain kinds of comedies that can get away with a complete lack of an identifiably human character arc . this doesn't seem like it should be one of them . how does one reconcile 90 minutes of grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways terribly sloppy ? perhaps the best course of action is simply to roll with it . from the outset , saving grace seems to have nearly every element in place for a wonderfully entertaining piece of middle-brow humor . blethyn anchors the film with a performance that's more restrained than recent outings like little voice , effectively playing incongruous moments like her attempts to sell her product on the streets of london while dressed like the queen mum . perhaps most refreshing , there's an unapologetic quality to the film's just-say-yes story line . it's all quite a bit of silly fun for those with no moral objections , until saving grace winds to its conclusion and it becomes evident that there's something missing -- namely , a third act . but saving grace doesn't bother with developing its characters . grace doesn't appear to grow or learn much of anything , and matthew's change of heart is tacked on almost as an afterthought . there's no sense of consequence anchoring anything that goes on in saving grace , like the unemployed full monty crew's search for a renewed sense of their manhood . it all begins to seem like little more than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits . it would feel like a complete violation of grace's character , if not for the fact that grace's character isn't developed carefully enough for there to be that much violation . such carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like saving grace , but somehow it doesn't quite . too many of the quirks work , and too many of the giggle fits inspire similar reactions from the audience . it's no masterwork of comic craftsmanship , but it does the job of taking you somewhere goofy and free of responsibility even though you know it's not particularly good for you . and maybe that's a fitting quality for a film about unapologetic pot smokers . ninety minutes of grins sounds about right . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6

"the problem with a story that relies almost exclusively on small talk is that they don't call it "" small "" talk for nothing . in robert altman's cookie's fortune , in which fishing is a favorite subject , a scrabble game gets significant screen time . you know the movie has problems when you find yourself more interested in the words on the board that the characters holding the tiles . the resulting confusion leaves you wondering why he can't restrain himself . one thing is certain ; altman can create atmospherics with the best of them . cookie's fortune is full of credible southern images , from the wide porches and ante-bellum homes to the sounds of the crickets and the banjos . with excruciating slowness , altman directs the script by anne rapp , which is so painfully obvious that you can guess all key events almost immediately . and when a young boy sees the key to the mystery , you can be sure that the adults will ignore him until just before the end of the movie . altman requires his viewers to endure half of the movie before the inevitable happens . you find yourself thinking that cookie should go ahead and shoot herself so the story can finally get in gear . the story's few tiny twists don't come until the end , but they involve a fairly uninteresting little subplot anyway . courtney b . vance is the no nonsense investigator . and lyle lovett is given a part that has little obvious purpose other than to give him a part in the movie . some humor ? la waiting for guffman would have been much-appreciated relief from the plot's tedium , but altman shies away from lampooning it as strongly as he should . the same could be said of the movie . it is rated pg-13 for adult themes , brief violence and some profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .",0.5
"renny harlin , whose previous directorial efforts include die hard 2 and cliffhanger , seems fond of big , explosive action pictures . unfortunately , excepting his debut ( the middle film in the die hard trilogy ) , plot coherency hasn't been a particularly important attribute of his movies . cliffhanger was little more than a series of spectacular stunts linked together by a paper-thin story . if anything , the strands of logic in cutthroat island are even thinner . fortunately , as a spectacle for the eye and ear , this high seas adventure is more than capable of capturing its audience's attention . holding it for more than two hours is a different matter altogether . . . however , while the special effects and explosions here far outstrip hollywood's early pirate movies , storyline , characterization , and acting are vastly inferior . thus , while cutthroat island may have cost $70 million to produce , it's still a pale shadow of its predecessors . the "" twist "" here , as already mentioned , is that the hero is a female . modine has absolutely no chemistry with co-star davis , and watching these two together is about as exciting as sitting through those dumb slideshow commercials that precede movies in many theaters . cutthroat island is more entertaining for its dumb storyline and overt silliness than for its nearly nonstop action . technology plays its part in what the film has to offer , as well . sound editing is excellent and the score ( written by john debney and performed by the london symphony orchestra ) is suitably rousing . cutthroat island is a mindless diversion . if , for whatever reason , you decide to go , maintain low expectations . hoping for more than a bunch of loud bangs and ridiculous dialogue will rob cutthroat island of its amusement value .",0.56

"when one examines the roster of the tens of thousands of motion pictures produced since the late 1800s , not many stand out as trailblazers . not only is this film a rousing adventure , but , upon its initial release , it revived science fiction as a viable movie medium , and , most importantly , began a special effects revolution that is still going on . industrial lights and magic , the premiere special effects house of the '80s and '90s , was born as a result of star wars , and its manifest contributions to the industry have included everything from making the starship enterprise fly to breathing life into the dinosaurs of jurassic park . it's impossible to estimate the full ramifications of star wars , but that single movie has surely influenced much about the making and marketing of motion pictures over the last two decades . when star wars was first released on the wednesday before memorial day in 1977 , it arrived in theaters with good reviews and excellent advance word . it was a true family film -- perfect for kids and parents , a throwback to the space serials of the past and a look ahead to what the future might hold . adults appreciated lucas' masterful , magical movie-making . suddenly , star wars was everywhere ; there were bed sheets , lunch boxes , trading cards , action figures , comic books , picture books , posters , records , and just about anything else you could imagine . the star wars fad , such as it was , lasted into the early '80s , and the original film received two additional theatrical runs . then it was on to the small screen . but watching the movie on videotape , which has been the exclusive viewing experience of just about anyone under the age of twenty , isn't the same as seeing it in a packed theater . now , however , with the advent of the original movie's twentieth anniversary and the promise of new films in another two years , star wars is as hot as it has ever been . those predicting anything less than a financial windfall for the special edition don't have the world's pulse . every year , a handful of movies are re-released to commemorate an anniversary . all of these feature new , clean prints . some have re- mixed soundtracks . a few , such as lawrence of arabia , vertigo , and the umbrellas of cherbourg , have been painstakingly restored . but lucas wanted more than this for star wars . he didn't just want to re-create the original theatrical experience , he wanted to improve upon it . so , in addition to cleaning up the print and re-mixing the soundtrack into a digital format , he has used state-of-the-art special effects to change the film's look . this includes adding more than four minutes of never- before-seen footage . and , while the new scenes don't appreciably improve the movie , they're fun to see , especially for anyone who has memorized every detail from the original . more importantly , although the newer , flashier effects subtly alter the star wars experience , they do not degrade it . these characters , familiar types with enough unique personality traits to brand them as individuals , have become so universally recognized that the mere mention of their names almost anywhere in the world will spur a reaction . another thing that's instantly recognizable about star wars is its music . few motion picture themes are as well-known and often-played as that of star wars . even the music from e . t . , the current highest-grossing film , doesn't leap as readily to mind . williams' evocative , grandiose score provides the perfect compliment to the star wars visual experience . star wars borrows from numerous sources , but the most obvious inspirations are the serialized adventures of flash gordon and buck rogers , arthurian legends , greek mythology , and akira kurosawa's the hidden fortress . there are also multiple nods to westerns and the dogfights of world war ii movies . but , like all great craftsmen , lucas has managed to fashion this material in a manner that not only honors the original sources , but makes it uniquely his own . during its original period of theatrical release , star wars' special effects were described as everything from "" eye popping "" to "" mind blowing "" . in fact , they're not bad even by today's standards . but "" not bad "" wasn't good enough for lucas , and his vision of what they should have been fills the screen in the special edition . however , in scenes both with and without effects improvements , star wars is just as compelling and invigorating a movie experience today as it was when it first came out , and the new stuff blends in seamlessly with the old . since 1977 , there have been many science fiction movies , but none has managed to equal star wars' blend of adventure , likable characters , and epic storytelling . like some indefatigable king of the hill , it stands alone and triumphant , regardless of the many imitators that assail its position . and watching this new edition today is like coming home after a long journey and finding everything just as you remember it -- if not better .",0.9
"this is not necessarily good in that the major suffering of the film is that it has play stamped all over it . plays are in-person experiences that happen in intimate settings . films take place on a much larger scale . this causes the wit and humor of the play to come across all too often as the pedantic ramblings and sermons of a couple of old men . the beauty of the language does come through , but the net effect of the movie is to make the viewers wish they had gone to the play instead . "" lies , not lies -- alternatives . sometimes the truth doesn't quite fit , "" argues nat . there are some interesting images in the picture . the long scenes of banter in the park undoubtedly worked well in the play . in the film , they are too long and preachy . more lively editing or camerawork would have helped . i find that matthau's acting frequently annoys me , but in this film i loved his work and that davis's . i empathized with them both . two convincing performances . less effective is the supporting cast . there is nothing wrong with their performances , but they provide little more than window dressing in this two person play . boyd gaines plays a jogging character named danforth who does have a single good line : "" truth is i hate running . being immortal takes too much time . "" if you like to watch for goofs , you can see the boom appear quite clearly twice in the famous "" i'm not rappaport "" joke sequence between nat and midge . most movie goers get entertainment , but i got a talky play masquerading as a movie . if you can get past the stilted filming , the film has a message worth hearing . i'm not rappaport runs too long at 2 : 15 because the play was not effectively adapted into a movie . it is rated pg-13 for dope smoking among the geriatric set . there is a little profanity and some violence , but no sex or nudity . the film's attitude about drugs makes me suggest that the film be seen only by kids who are over twelve . i found the filming frustrating , but i liked most of what the movie had to say so i am recommending it and giving it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6
"human traffic , written and directed by justin kerrigan , literally bursts with raw energy . set in the club scene in cardiff , wales , the movie is filled with hypnotically pulsating music that'll have you wanting to dance in the aisles . a funny and imaginative film , it is best thought of as a more good-spirited version of trainspotting . the humor , as it was in that hugely popular film , is drug-based . many viewers will have trouble enjoying the humor since they will not be able to get beyond the film's clearly pro-drug message . the language is true to the subjects , a bunch of kids just turned 20 , which means that a sentence without the f-word is like a day without sunshine . americans and those much older than the cast may have some trouble identifying with the kids and the setting . but the director somehow makes the film more universal than it might seem . the message of sex , drugs , and rock and roll , after all , will certainly remind you of the 60s . ( could too many drugs be a cause ? the story , not surprisingly , doesn't explore this angle . ) in the story's funniest sequence , he leads a sing-along to his own anthem . set to the tune of the british national anthem , the characters and the audience follow it to a bouncing ball on the words . it's high-spirited fun . the film's staging constantly surprises and delights . long portions of the story spend needless time listing the joys of a life of drugs . usually , but not always , these are quite humorous . by the end , the movie has transformed itself into a nice little romance between jip and lulu . the ending is as upbeat as a fred astaire movie . in fact , they looked like they were going to start dancing in the rain , but , alas , it was not to be . it is rated r for pervasive drug content , language and some strong sexuality and would be acceptable for college students and older .",0.6
"the idea of parodying the western , while certainly not a new notion , hasn't been done in a while . lightning jack may be a perfect example of why . blazing saddles this definitely isn't . lightning jack is a well-meaning but completely lifeless comedy that is short on humor and long on boredom . there are numerous examples of movies without a plot or a point , but few are as dull and meandering as this one . the laughs--which are supposed to be the payoff--are occasionally amusing , but there's far too much dead air in between . besides that , anyone having seen the theatrical trailer has seen nearly every moment worth seeing . this is not , however , the stuff that great humor is made of , and that comes across all-too-clearly in lightning jack . while the actor is pleasant enough to watch , this film is in desperate need of something beyond "" pleasant .

"director betty thomas ( private parts ) and writer susannah grant ( erin brockovich ) have more affinity for the comedic part of the story , but it is the tragic that is the most effective . the comedic , which only works in fits and spurts , serves more often as a detriment to the movie than an attribute . another problem with the picture is that we've seen it before and better . michael keaton in clean and sober was funnier and more chillingly convincing . and the frighteningly effective performance by meg ryan in when a man loves a woman put both movies shame . we get a brief glimpse at the movie's start of how much fun gwen has when wasted . this conflict between the sisters is the most promising and most underdeveloped part of the storyline . in an inspired bit of casting against type , steve buscemi plays gwen's counselor . his effect on her life appears as if it will be significant , but the movie only gives us a few cheap laughs before moving on . although interrupted periodically by genuine tragedy ( puking in the toilet from drug withdrawal , attempted suicides , ugly relapses , etc . ) , the movie spends most of its time and energy in search of laughs . most of the comedy troop seem lifted from some lame television sitcom . sometimes the movie successfully blends the comedic with the tragic . after choosing to show that time for gwen , the filmmakers made it seem way too easy for her . as simple as that . it is rated pg-13 for mature thematic elements involving substance abuse , language and some sensuality and would be acceptable for teenagers .",0.6
"windhorse takes us right into modern tibet and tells how the tibetans survive in a country that is not really theirs anymore . it is a well-done and necessary propaganda film ( though even its propaganda is nuanced and made lyrical to a large extent ) . somehow or other the world has to receive the message from the tibetans , who are undergoing at the hands of their suppressors , the chinese communists , a policy of genocide that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop it . this film is one of the ways of getting out this message . this fictionalized drama has to be told and this serious film ( probably preaching to the choir ) cannot be judged as other films are for its entertainment value . if you are seeing this film to be entertained , you are in the wrong movie house , though the exquisite natural beauty of the country and the entrancing holy city of lhasa- and its potala ( the largest buddhist structure in the world ) - offer quite a lot of sights to behold . the brutality the tibetans are under is clearly shown , as the film will tell its story as humanly as it can , through the eyes of one family , and it will show their hardships and disruptions to be symbolic for the sufferings of all tibetans . he steals the picture with this gut-wrenching performance . this travesty really hits home and shames them into actively supporting the non-violent tibetan cause for freedom . what is simply amazing throughout the story is the gentleness of the tibetans , who exhibit no violent tendencies despite all these incidents , and when you compare them with the barbarian behavior of their chinese rulers , you can easily see that this is a story of good vs . evil . it is easy to see why china doesn't want the truth about its human rights violations known , or about the murders it commits and acts of brutality , and its spy system and systematic control over its subjects , or how it refuses to allow the people to even have pictures of the dalai lama in their homes , arresting those that do . the film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note , as you would expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of buddhism . thereby , the film will rest its case that the spirit world will always be there for them . director wagner and screenwriter tsering have pulled off a major accomplishment . that makes this a very special film for me , but it will probably be too one-dimensional a story for those who feel it lacks the impact of dramatics and cannot forgive the film for urgently wishing to send out its message at the expense of being more "" artistic . "" but i left the theater with the impression that i was watching a brave people clinging to the belief that they could find in their hearts all the goodness they need to get over this dark spot in their history . i thought it was a well-meaning film that had its exceptional moments , like fully realizing the relationship of dadon and duan-ping as symbolic of the possible reconciliation of the two countrys . but does the film reach an audience that doesn't know thetibetan situation ? i hope it does reach a wider american audience than what i think it will , because i believe that the cause here is just , the acting is first-class , the film is beautifully crafted , and that all people of good faith must stand together and give hope to each other , in any small or large way that they can . if this fictionalized film wasn't about the real life situation in tibet and had the same mundane story , i could see it being criticized for being melodramatic . but since the politics of the times indicate that this film does make a difference , so much so that the chinese government is doing everything in its power to ban it , i therefore think that speaks volumes for how effective this film is as a political vehicle and how its cinematic importance is enhanced by the unflinching bravery of the tibetan actors and their families still living in tibet , still the subject of untold horrors .",0.7
"the film takes a lot of liberties with the original premise and characters , weaving a story that barely resembles the one which entertained tv audiences more than twenty years ago . oddly , even though the fugitive is an admitted chase movie , the scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie . we don't see much of the relationship between richard and helen kimble , but what we're presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the doctor . well-photographed and directed with a flair , this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats . most importantly , when on the run , kimble acts like an intelligent human being . equally as refreshing , the lawmen are his match , not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles . in fact , it could be argued that both kimble and gerard are too intelligent , not to mention too lucky . the plot is far from airtight , and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution . how much of these you accept depends on how much license you're willing to give the film makers . considering the overall quality of the movie , i think they deserve some room to maneuver , and most of the plot hiccups didn't bother me . the movie's pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the pursuit cools down and kimble's own search for the one armed man takes up screen time . there's a little more talking and less action during the middle portion of the movie . of course , the action predictably starts to build again as the closing moments arrive . the ending lacks originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not . there are too many leaps of intuition and handily placed clues . simplifying this part of the story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot , and a little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters . personally , i wasn't that interested in kimble's search . these moments are at the heart of the movie ; they make the picture work because it's through them that suspense is developed . a little more of this kimble/gerard interplay might have put the fugitive squarely on the same level as another of the summer's big thrillers , in the line of fire . with all apologies to harrison ford , who turns in a far more emotive and less wooden performance than in patriot games , the real acting standout is tommy lee jones . he invests his character with charisma and energy and , as gerard's grudging respect for kimble grows , so does our appreciation of what jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role . assuming that kimble is the good guy ( which the script goes out of its way to make clear ) , that means that gerard , who's chasing him , is the bad guy . while no one could accuse the fugitive of having a masterful insight into human nature , that's not why this film was produced . there's an odd moment or two when an element of someone's behavior strikes a responsive chord , but basically the characters are developed only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds . fans of the old tv series will find echoes of the show here , but most of this version is new . "" innovative "" is not a legitimate description of the fugitive , but "" entertaining "" is .",0.74
"soon a swirl of unanswered questions arise that make it clear that someone may be abusing oliver , but if so , who ? hollow reed is a great film of intense power and ensemble acting that tells the story of these two families . films like this defy characterization . the exquisite script by neville bolt and paula milne is a thriller and a mystery , an examination of child abuse , a discussion of what constitutes a family , an exploration of trust and love , and most of all , a character study . ( every time i try to tell my friends what sling blade is about , i can see from the looks on their faces that they will never go see it . so i fear it may be with hollow reed . the more you know about the superficial aspects of the plot , the less likely you are to want to see it , and yet this compelling film has the power of secrets and lies and deserves a wide audience . ) in a cast of wonderful actors , martin donovan , playing the father martyn , stands out for his incredible and yet understated performance . new film actor sam bould gives a touching performance as the small boy , ollie , at the heart of the controversy . but you must know , what is he covering up and why ? in excellent minor roles , david calder , from the bramwell tv series on masterpiece theater , plays martyn's sincere , but not very reassuring lawyer . even better is edward hardwicke as the judge who looks as though he may require the wisdom of solomon to sort the case out . the script takes care to build a detailed story , not the outline with which most plots content themselves . although the mystery is fairly transparent , director angela pope nevertheless manages to keep the tension high . in the best of thrillers , of which this is one , the eerie calmness of most of the scenes creates more foreboding than cataclysmic events ever could . there is a composed , redemption scene that will have you wanting to scream , "" no ! "" and when hannah says , "" it'll never happen again , "" about the abuse , your stomach will likely go into knots . i am not going to give anything away . if you've seen the trailers or read any of the other reviews , you already know more than the little i've told you . i want you to see the film fresh so its power can overwhelm you as it did me . although never manipulative , the intelligent script and moving acting may reduce you to tears even though almost all of the abuse happens off screen . i saw it at a press-only screening with only a half dozen critics present , but i could hear frequent weeping around me . rarely does this happen at such an event . the ending of the movie is strikingly photographed by remi adefarasin and directed with precision and power by angela pope . although the brief epilog afterwards is satisfying , since it allows you to know how the players put their lives back together , it detracts slightly from the film's intensity . then again , perhaps most viewers need that catharsis to make their emotional system whole again after such an experience . it is not rated but would be an r for mature themes , language , sex , and nudity . this is not an nc-17 film , and the abuse is of a physical and not a sexual nature . the film would be fine for mature teenagers . i recommend the picture strongly and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.8

"ghosts of mississippi , director rob reiner's 1996 academy award contender and his follow-up to last year's the american president , tells this compelling story using a solid , if somewhat unconventional , cast . baldwin is fine in the role , although far from oscar material . whoopi goldberg gives an uneven performance as myrlie evers , starting out rather unconvincingly , but finishing strong . james woods , who almost always plays bad guys these days , is creepy and unsettling as the despicably cock-sure de la beckwith . as a courtroom drama , ghosts of mississippi is reasonably successful . the trial , which carefully follows the actual transcript from 1994 , avoids the contrived , theatrical twists that mar many similar films . as a result of this verisimilitude , the courtroom aspects of ghosts of mississippi are intelligent rather than over-the-top . we care about the characters and what happens to them . one problem , which at least makes one wonder about the film's intentions , is fairly obvious : this is yet another example of a story where a white hero enters the civil rights fray and becomes the lead player . even though this is the way events actually happened ( the real delaughter is caucasian ) , there's little doubt that setting up a white man ( alec baldwin ) as the central figure makes the film more "" accessible "" and appealing to the predominantly-white , mainstream crowds who frequent multiplexes . even though none of this material is groundbreaking , it is presented in an interesting manner . either we are making slow progress , step by step , to a better future , or , "" emotionally , we will always be segregated .

"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . from that moment on , it's all downhill . whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . there isn't any real acting in this film . christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . fortunately , there are only two elements left . - ingmar bergman",0.4

"satyajit ray's 28th and last film , he died in 1992 , is one that he shot in radiant color , and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one , it is much better than some of his recent films , which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like , to be in a decline with the modern theater goer's taste . this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization . the plot is rather plain . this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before , as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled , but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor . the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle . ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots . the opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability . his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it .",0.8
"if it comes to a city near you , as it is now in our area , you'd better see it immediately or it'll be history before you can blink an eye . and being easily one of the most unusual family films in years , you don't want to let this one slip by you . even if you haven't got any kids - the adults outnumbered the children in our saturday matinee audience by 10 to 1 - you don't want to miss out on this little delight . writer and director terry jones sticks fairly close to the story and the cadence of the original kenneth grahame novel . and his players approach their parts almost reverentially as befits such a classic . it is not until the movie's midway point , during toad's trial , that the actors begin to really cut loose with the comedy . up until then they keep the humor on the subtle side , which is fine since it is in its delicacy and beauty that the film is most effective . if you're looking for a cartoonish action picture , in which stupidity reigns supreme and bonks on the head are the height of comedy , this isn't it . as filmed by con air's cinematographer david tattersall , the radiant picture has a golden autumnal look . every one of the daylight scenes appear to have been filmed when the sun was low on the horizon , basking everything in a loving glow . the man in the iron mask's costume designer , james acheson , came up both with the magical costumes that carefully evoke each actor's animal and with the sets worthy of a disney theme park attraction . ( in fact , those who have been to disneyland will cherish mr . toad's wild ride even more after seeing it acted out in the movie . ) the evil weasels , for example , have long orange coats and hair , dark elliptical sunglasses , and devilish little mustaches . and so forth through all of the other animals . nicol williamson is the take-charge badger . although played fairly straight , the show's outlandish touches , such as toad's long tongue that he uses to catch flies and even to help him escape , are done sparingly . the movie has not only dialog but a bit of singing as well . the whole story is developed in such an offbeat and methodical manner that many people , especially kids , may not know quite what to make of it . if they've read the book , it probably helps , but those looking for the traditional movie-going experience may be mystified by this one . for those with an open mind and heart , the picture is a treasure worth savoring . don't miss this delicate mixture of tenderness and whimsy . if you wait , it'll be gone as fast as toad in one of his motor cars . it is rated pg for fanciful villainy and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , and his friend george , age 7 , thought the film was good , especially the scene in which the heroes dance on the table while punching the weasels .",0.7
"this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have .",0.7
"this is an authentic "" dogma 95 "" film , as before the film opens , that assurance comes with a signed guaranteed shown on the screen that it was made according to the rules stipulated by the danish directors who founded this school of sparse filmmaking -- lars von trier and thomas vinterberg . the hand-held camera was obvious throughout the film as were the film's lack of special effects , supposedly giving the viewer a chance to discover on their own any beauty worth finding in the film , rather than to be hit over the head with it . like all dogmas , they eventually wear out whatever usefulness they might have had in the first place . soren kragh-jacobsen's "" mifune "" is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's "" celebration "" and von trier's "" idiots . "" it is the weakest of the three , but still , it has some punch in a conventional way due to the film's technical clarity . it is a playfully weird telling of a familiar romantic comedy situation , much like a hollywood formula film . it has a lot of dead spots where it tried comedy and a lot of predictability as far as its romantic situation , but it also had a certain intrinsic beauty about it that kept it afloat and made it seem better than its story was . it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers . a rather trite choice of subject matter for a group that i would have thought to be more politically motivated . what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields . this film doesn't go against that observation . now i would have bet anyone in the theater and have given them 10-1 odds , that was the last of the marriage , that's how obvious this plot was . her smile is the pure one , while claire also smiles , but her's is a selfish one . this dogma 95 film left me unmoved , though its story was pleasant and well-crafted . it just felt too much like an art-house film designed to please its audience rather than to be provocative .",0.5
"starring : anders danielson lie , frank robert , elisabeth sand , bjorn floberg director : erik gustavson producer : petter j . borgli screenplay : lars saabye christensen music : randall meyers released by rko pictures norwegian with english subtitles herman is a lugubrious film about a relatively uninteresting subject : the tribulations of a young boy who is going bald . admittedly , with a script infused with lively wit or emotionally- wrenching pathos , it is possible to make a coming-of-age story entertaining . the instances of humor , while occasionally amusing , are easily telegraphed , and there's very little in the film to form an emotional link between the title character and the audience . going bald is likely to be a traumatic event for someone just out of his first decade of life , but the lack of any palpable threat to herman's health makes it difficult to feel for him . the film really doesn't go anywhere . often , it's difficult to gain an understanding of what herman's real goal is . overall , i suppose it's trying to give us a picture of a young boy who isn't afraid to be unusual , and who eventually overcomes his problems through that sense of individuality , but it's a message that takes too long to get across . this is not an involving movie . it's not bad--there are enough quirks of character to assure that--but neither is it good . for those who like straightforward villains , a few of the kids in herman's class fit the bill nicely . this whole part of the story is fairly trivial . although herman attempts to be another my life as a dog , it doesn't come close . that film had an emotional impact . we were drawn into the on-screen lives of the characters . herman keeps us too much at a distance . there are a few moments of genuine insight , but nothing lasting . in the end , instead of an emotionally-vibrant motion picture experience , this movie turns out to be something of a dud .",0.5
"it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country . but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes . taking the southern side , the film found humor in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape photographed , and reasons in the southern cause which doomed them to failure . but many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic presentation . this explains a key weakness of the southern cause , according to the filmmaker , that the southern values are tradition-bound and part of a static culture . they have been spending their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much like sermons , so sue lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time . though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell . it was a dull film , the acting was misplaced , the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted . it never got around to being an entertaining film , and it could never be perceived as just an informative film , because it could never quite spit out what it was trying to say . i also found tobey maguire's performance grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous films .",0.5

"" we see the carpet as if were a magical one as it is spread out on the water . for those who value persian rugs , they realize this is so because of the all stories and detail that go into the carpet , making it an inspired work of art that gives it its intrinsic value ; it is a work of art that is unrivaled precisely because it is made without set patterns . the film was originally sponsored by the persian carpet industry hoping to have it made as a documentary . but if you can ignore that , you will see a film that turns out to be so endearing , that you will be taken in by the power of its raw beauty . this seems to be too much for the young girl to endure . i quite frankly don't understand all the cultural ramifications of the tale and what the exact meaning of its conclusion amounts to , but that didn't hinder me from being amazed by the stunningly lush landscapes seen and from enjoying the film as is . iranian films of this nature require a different way of looking at them , something that american audiences might take a lot of getting used to . this artistic ( not poetic ) film , is one that is not necessarily better than american films , as much as it is different from them . don't look for the usual hollywood formula contrivances to drive the film to its conclusion . this fairy tale film is a feast for hungry eyes ( i can't get over how the wheat fields depicted looked so much like van gogh's ) . but , with that being said , i would be remiss if i did not mention that this simple tale , is one that has almost no insight into modern iran ; it is a popular film , aimed at upsetting no one-- foreigner and iranian alike . if i had to compare it with an american type of film it most closely resembles , i would have to say a "" disney "" film . in other words , this is not a personal film , one in which the director's poetical vision is inspirational . instead , it is a safe non-political , though , beautifully shot romantic fantasy , that is more pleasing to the eye than to the mind . it is one to be admired , as one does a beautiful woman , but it is not one that invites further introspection .",0.5

"although at his best in a live monologue , his screen adaptations shine as well . to most people , sitting through a movie where one guy talks for an hour and a half sounds like torture . unlike his previous monologue pictures , gray's anatomy opens with someone other than spalding . this eight minute introduction could easily have people heading for the exits . the stories' validity make them all the more hard to think about . and you can imagine the possibilities with oven cleaner and fish hooks . you get the idea . although this portion of the film diverges from the tradition of featuring spalding and only spalding , it effectively sets the stage for the film's topic -- spalding's macular pucker . if you did not cover pucker in your biology class , don't worry , spalding quickly turns you into an expert . the best part of the film surrounds the long story of his seeking to be healed by visiting a native american sweat lodge with a bunch of swedish looking men and women . spalding always manages to find and talk about some of the world's most interesting human beings , and this film is no exception . spalding has had small acting parts in thirty traditional films , but has made only two previous monologue movies . directors do make a difference . swimming to cambodia was directed by jonathan demme ( the silence of the lambs and philadelphia ) , and demme understood and appreciated spalding's unique talents so he resisted the urge to embellish the film . gray's anatomy's director steven soderbergh ( sex , lies , and videotape ) has no such respect for spalding . soderbergh , lacking confidence in the audience's intelligence , feels that he must jazz up the production with cute camera work and bizarre lighting . although soderbergh's madness does have a purpose -- he wants you to feel what it is like to lose you eyesight -- it , nevertheless , only serves to be a tremendous distraction . i want to see spalding , not a talking shadow or a man blurred with harsh backlight . the cinematography by elliot davis deserves one of those "" worst of the year "" awards . i was fortunate to see spalding do monster in a box in a lovely and intimate outdoor setting . he does not need soderbergh's wizardry . if you cannot see spalding gray live , then do see his monologue films . gray's anatomy can be infuriating , but spalding makes it worthwhile . the film is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 for the brief profanity and sexual references . it should be fine for kids say 10 and up . i would not have missed it , so i recommend it to you and give it * * 1/2 for a terribly flawed but intriguing monologue . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : may 4 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6
"so what kind of a man was harry lime ? director carol reed's classic the third man has just been restored and is in the process of being re-released theatrically . now , with the restoration of the 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the american release by producer david o . selznick , we can see the film as continental audiences first saw it . not having seen the movie in what seems like a zillion years , but which must be less than 50 since the film originally came out in 1949 , i was able to look at it again with few preconceived notions . set in a post-world-war-ii vienna , the picture does a masterful job of recreating an era of complex politics and a city picking itself up from the ashes . in the story by graham greene and alexander korda , the ambiguous characters perfectly match robert krasker's heavily shadowed black-and-white cinematography . the characters' exact intentions and motivations are up for discussion . seeing the movie again after all these years , i was struck by several things . although harry lime is the central character , wells has a remarkably small part . his first appearance in the movie has a power and a charm that makes it one of the most endearing scenes in cinematic history . with its dominant austrian zither music , the film serves notice that it doesn't intend to fit neatly into any genre . the music is whimsical , mysterious and sometimes even a little sad . every time you start to ponder a situation seriously , the music comes up to suggest that things may not be quite what they seem . and it warns us not to take things too seriously . the writers seem to be just off camera , laughing with little in-jokes that they alone understand . the scene in the ferris wheel , in which harry draws a heart on the glass , is one such moment . how is it to be taken ? the writers seem to enjoy toying with us . the overwhelming emotion on seeing it again is to realize how the picture works best on a visual and a musical level . one could imagine doing away with all of the dialog and relying on the pictures and the music alone . actually , the only truly memorable line is harry's reflection to holly . space operas aside , one wonders which films of today will still be popular 50 years from now . this simple question is harder than it might appear since it involves not only artistic merit but also changing opinions . while waiting for the mid-twenty-first century's official classics list , go enjoy some of the sure winners now , like the third man , especially if you're lucky enough to have it playing theatrically in your area . it is rated pg for mature themes and would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested , which probably means around 12 and up .",0.9
"the fortress is not a nice place , and its director ( kurtwood smith ) is an emotionless servant of machines . every time a movie about the near future presents such a bleak picture of life on earth , i always hope for a reasonable explanation about how things got so bad . personally , i don't think that's too much to ask . however , for the most part , the film makers don't agree ( apologies to pictures such as the terminator series ) , since they could care less about such details . fortress falls right into that category . we can make a few guesses based on clues presented in the film , but even the best picture will be incomplete . the pattern of this film is unusual . most movies , no matter how good or bad , have peaks and valleys during the course of their running time . fortress , on the other hand , while starting at a pretty high level , manages a consistent downward trend throughout . it's somewhat out-of-the-ordinary to be able to say that a movie gets uniformly worse with every passing scene . it's only the strength of the beginning that keeps this film from collapsing into the nether regions inhabited by such nightmares as split second , another science fiction gorefest that takes place in a dreary near-future earth . the early minutes of fortress are brimming with promise . scenes bristle with the potential of interesting characters , strong interaction , and intelligent plot twists . alas , little or nothing comes of most of these instances ; they become a method of cruel teasing , tantalizing the viewer with what might have been . the film degenerates from intriguing to routine to dumb , all in the space of ninety minutes . by the end , it's all formula . the action has become commonplace and the characters flat . the cast does a reasonable job . christopher lambert is probably a better actor than the role deserves , and he occasionally manages to make jack brennick believable . lincoln kilpatrick does as much as he can with a secondary part , creating one of the few minor characters that the audiences comes to care about . ultimately , fortress is nonsense , even if the slick futuristic setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences . it's also at this point that significant plot implausibilities start cropping up . one thing fortress has going for is an impressive visual style--at least for those who can stand a lot of gore . there are exploding stomachs , dismembered bodies , and a great deal of blood--all done quite graphically , for the most part ( would you expect anything different from the director of re-animator ? ) . the set design is excellent , and the action scenes are well-paced , if lacking in legitimate surprises . fortress isn't terrible science fiction , but it's far from the top . hampered by a storyline that never reverses a downward trend , the movie is unable to get on course . not the best company to be in , but it could be worse . watch split second and you'll understand how bad things can get in this genre . after that experience , fortress will look like high art .",0.44

"inventive animated tale produced by george lucas and directed by john korty and charles swenson . fast , witty story isn't for all children , especially those who won't have patience for its unique look and flippant , incidental storyline . visually , film is a combination of rainbow-hued watercolors , pen and ink , live action , and still photographs . its endearingly scrappy look is matched by its throwaway dialogue - i can imagine this being the kind of cartoon robert altman might produce . hip characters provide many laughs , especially overenthusiastic superhero rod rescueman ( james crenna ) , and a nonchalant fairy godmother ( judith kahan kampmann ) . there's also the nominal lead character ralph , a thing that looks like an extra from yellow submarine ( voice actor lorenzo music ) . film's main basis for characterization is to play against stereotype - an idea we're overly familiar with now , but don't mind in this case because the whole production has such an easygoing feel about it . the animators slip in many visual gags , mostly to do with film and television - one of the characters is an aspiring actress , another an aspiring writer , another an aspiring heroic lead . most interesting visual effects occur when we see a nightmare activated in the world of the rushers . x-status : status : o australia , 1995 u . s . release date : 2/97 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 45 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( sex , nudity , mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast : john lynch , jacqueline mckenzie , colin friels , deborra-lee furness , daniel daperis director : michael rymer producers : timothy white and jonathan shteinman screenplay : michael rymer cinematography : ellery ryan music : john clifford white u . s . distributor : cinepix film properties the reason ? despite certain thematic similarities , shine is an upper ; angel baby is a downer . depressing or not ( i suppose it depends on your point-of-view ) , there's no denying angel baby's emotional power . this is the sort of film that lays it all on the line , and requires the kind of intense commitment from its lead actors that few motion pictures demand . the sheer intensity of their emotion has disastrous consequences , for , although harry and kate believe their love is strong enough to overcome anything -- even insanity -- the reality is far less romantic or forgiving . watching this film , i was reminded strongly of a couple of recent motion pictures : jude ( which is based on thomas hardy's jude the obscure ) and breaking the waves . both of those films , like angel baby , deal with the effects of a powerful , all-consuming love . in one way or another , both of these threads are echoed in angel baby , which explores not only the transcendent power of love , but its limitations , as well . writer/director michael rymer's imperfect narrative contains a few contrived missteps , but the characters and their relationships are so effectively conceived and expertly realized that it's difficult to fault the film much for this . angel baby is well-focused on an emotional level , and i found myself unexpectedly touched by this unconventional love story . there's far more than mental illness and its attendant pain to harry and kate's relationship . the tenderness , eroticism , and ecstasy of their interaction leaves the most forceful impression . for those watching the film in the united states , it's worth acknowledging an unusal bit of cross-cultural trivia . having seen angel baby , it's easy for me to understand why major distributors like fine line and miramax stayed away . much like breaking the waves , it's a raw , intense , carnal film that will appeal most strongly to adventurous movie-goers . actually , it's ironic that the very qualities which scared off everyone except cinepix film properties are those that give angel baby its unique identity and make it such a compelling viewing experience .",0.8

"if you can imagine a screenplay that cobbles together elements of trial by jury , the pelican brief , and congo , you have a fairly good idea what to expect from this movie . as soon as you think the juror can't get any more silly , it will inevitably prove you wrong . this is yet another in a * long * line of inane thrillers to pit "" ordinary "" people against amazingly-intelligent , incredibly-nasty , often-psychotic adversaries . add the juror to an already overpopulated category that includes the hand that rocks the cradle , unlawful entry , pacific heights , single white female , the tie that binds , and eye for an eye . there are three prerequisites this kind of film : the basic storyline must have little or no basis in reality , the main character ( s ) must be unreasonably virtuous , and the villain must be evil incarnate . get ready for demi moore in yet another high-profile , artistically barren motion picture . unlike disclosure , however , which was actually enjoyable , the juror is a trial to sit through . the movie would like viewers to believe it has something relevant to say about the ease with which our legal system can be abused , but , in the end , all the posturing about the need for a "" reasonable doubt "" in criminal cases becomes just another lame plot element . the juror never comes close to making a serious statements about crime or justice . director brian gibson wants thrills and shocks , not potentially thought-provoking questions . at first , she's excited to be selected , but it doesn't take long for the thrill to turn to terror . if this plot sounds familiar , that's because it's a retread of 1994's trial by jury , another horrible courtroom thriller about jury tampering . it's like a bad john grisham plot -- lots of danger and running around , little of which ultimately means anything . for the most part , the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of formula motion picture . demi moore is the lone exception -- it's rare that she's believable for more than part of a scene . supporting players joseph gordon-levitt , anne heche , and james gandolfini all do solid , if unspectacular , jobs . however , no number of competent performances can save the juror . the painfully obvious storyline is what sinks this movie , and even the most accomplished cast couldn't have done much more with the material . this motion picture is guilty of wasting the time of anyone who wants even a modicum of intelligence in their entertainment .",0.3

"" and in spurts , it's actually possible to do so . in those scenes , eraser is pure mindless fun in the best sense of the term , but those scenes are also somewhat isolated . there is a surprising grimness to much of eraser , including two separate incidents where kruger takes an excruciatingly long time to remove a piece of shrapnel from his flesh , and schwarzenegger himself is overly somber in much of his performance , brooding over a dark past to which we are not made privy . these token attempts by russell and his screenplay-by-committee team to make schwarzenegger more vulnerable and human demonstrate a real misunderstanding of his appeal . audiences come to see schwarzenegger the super-hero , and to laugh along with his awareness of the absurd situations in his action films ; he is the master of the catch phrase because they are winking distillations of those absurdities . there are far too few opportunities to laugh in eraser , except those provided by robert pastorelli as the motor-mouthed wiseguy who becomes kruger's assistant . the irony of eraser is that it turns its greatest asset into a weakness . in a season filled with films which seem to be playing hyped-up games of "" can you top this ?

"screenplay : john richards and james flamberg . director : neil labute . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 110 minutes . there's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant . groundhog day could have been ridiculous and repetitive , but it charmed you with an unexpectedly touching romance ; being john malkovich could have been a simplistic tale of misguided celebrity worship , but it turned into an absurdist existential fantasy worthy of ionesco . hollywood excels at selling stories in a single sentence , and we come to expect that we know all there is to know about the film from that sentence . when it becomes evident that there's more to a film than its marketing-savvy premise , it's a heart-warming experience indeed . nurse betty isn't as thematically rich as either groundhog day or being john malkovich , and it's certainly not as thematically rich as director neil labute's dazzling debut in the company of men . it is , however , a peculiarly entertaining comedy that sticks in the brain for a while longer than you expect . it's entirely possible that nurse betty could have succeeded as a comedy strictly on the basis of its wild premise . labute directs with effective comic short-hand -- a scene portraying del in the middle of an affair with his secretary shows wear marks on the wall to emphasize his recidivist philandering -- and paces his showpiece sequences with a flair you might not expect from the misanthropic mind behind in the company of men . there are sharp visual gags like betty's perky look in her bloody nurse's outfit after performing an impromptu medical procedure , and slick exchanges of dialogue between charley and wesley . the performances are not uniformly appealing -- rock yells without doing much acting , and eckhart's mullet-headed lout of a husband is as broad a stereotype as you'll find - but the work by zellweger , freeman and kinnear more than takes up the slack . it's simply a funny comedy . simply funny , but far from simplistic . nurse betty takes the somewhat trite notion of soap operas as vicarious life for those with unhappy lives and twists it into provocative knots . the resolution may come to some obvious conclusions about the need to face reality , but along the way it shows a respect for the complexity of our coping mechanisms , whatever form they may take . with so much strong stuff at the center , it's a shame that nurse betty gets flabby around the edges . the attempts at entertainment industry satire don't always mesh with the edgier stuff , and the tone shifts from intense to playful on a dime . in fact , by all rights it should be just another affably mediocre piece of hollywood joke-mongering . yet even with its bumps and scrapes , nurse betty feels like more . there's something at stake , something recognizably human , something you don't often find in high-concept comedy . thanks to zellweger , freeman and ( of all people ) neil labute , there's a heart here , and a brain , too . it's an approach that takes a high concept just a bit higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.7
"the madness of king george is a movie based on the play titled the madness of george iii . ( i have been told it was retitled for the us because american audiences during the test marketing thought it was a sequel and wondered what happened in parts i and ii , but i think that is just probably just another urban legend . ) many twists and turns from there with an ending you may have some trouble predicting if you are not up on your british history of that era . the historical story is fascinating and is the only reason to see the movie . the period costumes are well done , and the sets are carefully chosen . the acting is earnest , and hawthorne does try awfully hard to present a believable madman . on the bad side , the movie is extremely tedious and pedantic . for example , i lost count of how many times the scriptwriter had us hear about the color of the king's "" water "" and "" stool . "" moreover , we had to have numerous didactic lectures from doctors about the exact color of the king's "" water "" and much speculation on what the color meant . perhaps they were , but i wonder about the historical accuracy of this caricature . finally , although the actors tried to give their best performances , i found that i did not care about any of the characters as written , and this comes from a guy who has taken seven vacations to britain and who knows a lot of english history . the madness of king george runs an overly long 1 : 50 . it has no mpaa rating , but it is clearly a pg-13 show for a little profanity and for adult themes . this movie would be fine for any teenager . other than british historians , i do not recommend this movie to anyone , and i award it * 1/2 solely for the history i learned by watching it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.4
"all the sounds heard in the cell are the ones you would normally hear in a prison . there was no background music to take your mind off where you were , and by going through in precise real-time movements the daily prison grind , the constant personal searches and searches of the food parcels the men received , with the guard slicing up the rice puddings looking for files and such , the viewer gets the feeling what prison life is like for the men . there is something about claude that makes him stick out as an outsider , someone you don't feel right about . maybe its just that he comes off as too cunningly mannipulative in his contact with others to be thought of as a true friend . yet , he fits in so well with his new cellmates by not calling attention to himself and acting grateful for their quiet acceptance of him , that it is easy to see how he could be accepted by the men . they have accepted claude as one of them , as there was no reason not to , and feel that he has done his part so far in helping them dig a tunnel and has even shared with them the food parcels he has received . what he has created in this thriller is a marvel in simplicity and understated relationships , showing how uncertain it could be to trust an outsider with your life . that",0.8
"screenplay : pamela gray . director : tony goldwyn . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . a walk on the moon is a coming-of-age film , which may lead you to expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation ; it's set during 1969's summer of love -- and at woodstock , no less -- which may lead you to expect even more "" wonder years "" -esque navel-gazing than usual . there are some pleasant surprises in a walk on the moon , actor tony goldwyn's directing debut , but the most pleasant may be that it's mature . taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing american summer , it's a simple , occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to realize that comings-of-age don't happen exclusively to teenagers . this summer seems certain to be something different , however . pearl's story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time of social upheaval . though gray occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text ( alison : "" you had your chance to be the kid ! "" pearl : "" no , i didn't ! "" ) , a walk on the moon generally lets diane lane's solid performance bring out pearl's conflicts . goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his 1960s catskills milieu as a distinct , amusing time and place . the portrayals do occasionally drift into the stereotypical , notably tovah feldshuh as marty's predictably iron-willed , oy-spouting mother , but the characters still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world . when the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the generation-defining concert -- including a quick skinny-dip in the camp's private lake -- it provides a well-realized picture of the new freedom that calls to pearl . the only reason a walk on the moon feels awkward is that it fumbles the sub-plot involving alison's own adventures . they take a half-hearted middle ground when one of the two extremes -- focusing entirely on pearl or making the two stories equally significant -- would have been genuinely effective . fortunately , when a walk on the moon sticks with pearl's growth -- including getting to know who her husband _really_ is for the first time -- it's an appealing character study . from its atmosphere to its acting , it's a nicely grown-up story of growing up , not just physically but emotionally . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"this thriller is directed by doug jackson ; it will best explore the fast-paced business world and its sterile atmosphere , where not telling the truth or stretching the truth in different ways is the norm . it succeeds in capturing that frenetic yuppie need for material things and how that greed blinds the quality of life . but what it fails to do , is build a mystery that goes beyond what could be read in the newspapers . you get a few spine tingling moments out of the heroine's self-made misfortunes and a surprise twist in the ending , but you don't get a lasting sense that this isn't all manufactured tension to fit too neatly into its premise of how anyone can be a victim of a random act of violence and have their life put through the ringer . his most revealing comment is , "" i love to surround myself with beautiful things . i love beautiful women , smart , and powerful women . "" the the film became difficult to watch from here on . it was hard too warm up to her plight , though it was remotely possible to see how she got into this messy situation . the script was too thin and had to be padded with too many non-involving scenes . the film annoyed me more than it enlightened or entertained me . there didn't seem anything special about the acting and too many of the secondary characters were put in there as props to echo the director's point he was making of greed influencing corporate decisions . it didn't have the suspense of a hitchcock film , instead it had more the look of a second-rate movie made for tv , which could be entertaining for a late night audience that is not that demanding .",0.4

"when i went into the press screening of prefontaine , i was excited on several counts . first , and foremost , director steve james's last picture was the great documentary hoop dreams , which he produced and directed . i cannot tell you how much i loved that movie . it easily made the top of my best of the year list for 1994 as it did both siskel's and ebert's . second , it was exciting to see a brilliant documentarian try his hand at his first non-documentary . before i begin commenting of the quality on the film , a warning is perhaps in order . he was great , but i cannot say the same for the film about his life . it was a big disappointment for me . the biggest problem with the movie is the script by steve james and eugene corr . it rarely rings true and is full of trite little phrases . the more obvious , but actually secondary , problem is that james decided to make prefontaine as if it were a documentary . there are numerous cuts to talking heads where the actors with the character's names below them talk as if they were not actors . a little of this might have worked , but combined with the poor script , it came off as terribly stilted . the film's pacing is uneven so that the film frequently drags . many scenes that editor peter frank should have deleted are included . leto has deep blue eyes that seem to engulf the viewer . although physically charming , i had a lot of trouble believing leto was the pre that they talked about . leto smiles excessively and is never convincing as someone who is supposedly so obsessed with winning . his signature role was as sgt . if you recognize his voice , it may be because he did the voice of the sergeant in toy story . in prefontaine he plays his character as too aloof and quirky . except for the great shoes he makes for pre , ermey's coach seems disinterested and fairly useless . my suspicion is that bowerman was more than just the cobbler to which the film relegates him . easily the best part of the picture is when pre is running . too often the film is full of talking heads and short , hallow speeches when it should have been back on the field . the further the film gets away from the track , the more it bogs down . pre has to answer mindless questions from the reporters like , "" hey pre , how you going to beat the best of the world on their turf ? "" pre's story is reduced to a series of banal sound bites by the script and the editor . the film tries to cast the organization that runs amateur track ( atu ) as a villain , but it makes the atu into such a pillsbury doughboy that it is not particularly effective . "" i hate christmas and thanksgiving and easter -- anything that breaks my routine . "" many actors are wasted in the film , but none so badly as amy locane , who was excellent last year in her lolita-style part in carried away . most people missed her performance in it , which is a shame . this talented actress is given a part with no substance . very few documentarians are good at making feature length movies . he should stick to what he does best . it is rated pg-13 for two intense , but non-graphic , violent scenes and for some profanity . there was what appeared to be a seven-year-old near me . the movie scared him quite a bit in the intense parts . kids , say nine or ten and up , should be able to handle the movie fine . a close call , but prefontaine is not well made enough for me to recommend it . that i would like to see . i give the movie prefontaine * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.5
"starring : michael keaton , andie macdowell , richard masur , john delancie , eugene levy , harris yulin . screenplay : chris miller , mary hale , lowell ganz , babaloo mandel , harold ramis . director : harold ramis . there have been many instances where my positive reaction to a film has been as much a result of what it _wasn't_ as what it was , and groundhog day may be the perfect example . on paper , it was a high-concept premise with nowhere to go , an over-extended "" twilight zone "" episode with a laugh-track . there didn't appear to be any way to make an infinitely repeated day anything but infinitely repetitious , but director/co-writer harold ramis and co-writer danny rubin startled me with a comedy of improbable inventiveness and even more improbable resonance . multiplicity , ramis' latest project , arrives with many of the same warning signs , and again it stays fresher through its running time than you might expect . this time , however , the comedy is as instantly disposable as it is enjoyable . almost no time to enjoy any of them . but even two doug kinneys doesn't seem to be enough , and when doug #3 enters the picture , the opportunities for disaster multiply right along with him . in a way that groundhog day never was , multiplicity really is a gimmick film . multiplicity is always about the farce of several doug kinneys getting each other into trouble , and the fact that it works so well and so often shows how artfully ramis is able to execute that farce . the comedy gets rather broad with doug #4 , the "" copy of a copy "" who turns out to be "" special , but the situations are great showcases for those characters , and keaton does some good work considering he is often working with no one but himself . multiplicity is a very funny film , full of clever touches like the character of a blissfully incompetent sub-contractor played by eugene levy and a housing development called "" vista del nada "" ( view of nothing ) , and it's easy to keep smiling through most of its 110 minutes . unfortunately , its attempts at a message get rather muddled . contributing screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( city slickers , forget paris ) have a tendency to paint emotional situations in extremely broad strokes , and that leads to some rather forced conflicts between doug and laura . andie macdowell , who was so good in groundhog day , doesn't have the chance to make an impression here ; her character is a necessity , not an individual . there are a number of rough edges in multiplicity ( including the excessively grainy special effects photography by richard edlund which allow the four dougs to interact ) , and they are mostly the result of an attempt to be the kind of film groundhog day was : a laugh-out-loud comedy which also managed to be about something warm and human . that kind of film is a rarity indeed , and it is no sin to have aspirations to that kind of completeness . in multiplicity , one laugh usually turns into another .",0.7
"the film , on the other hand , isn't quite so resolute . the images are powerful and immediate , but they become the story rather than complementing it . henderson begins to seem like a character digitally insterted , forrest gump-like , into historical events . when the story does focus on his actions , it fumbles away too many opportunities to personalize its grand-scale tragedy . character relationships , like those between henderson and a brash american reporter ( woody harrelson ) and his no-nonsense producer ( kerry fox ) , get just enough attention to be frustrating ; henderson's devotion to an orphan named emira ( emira nusevic ) is rushed until it feels more like a cinematic necessity than a genuine connection . even the film's most potentially intense sequence , involving the illegal transport of a bus-load of orphans out of the country , feels strangely sedate despite one gripping encounter at a bosnian checkpoint . that sequence doesn't even serve as the film's climax , leading into a dry 20-minute search for emira's birth mother which grinds welcome to sarajevo to a halt . far too often , winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce demonstrate a clumsy disregard for building a narrative with an emotional pull beyond its bursts of authentic violence . i can easily imagine a film like welcome to sarajevo degenerating into pathos in hollywood hands , so perhaps it deserves some credit for avoiding copious shots of sad-eyed waifs . winterbottom simply goes too far in the other direction . the performances and direction are sturdy but rarely inspired , resulting in a film which makes us feel terrible about this tragic conflict in a very abstract sense . welcome to sarajevo is good reporting , but it's not particularly good drama , treating its subject with the concerned detachment of a newsmagazine feature story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"jekyll and mr . there's also a none-too-subtle message about the dangers of letting the advancements of science outstrip corresponding ethics . moreau is a tale of great substance ; as re-invented by director john frankenheimer ( the manchurian candidate ) , it's disappointingly shallow and pointless . this is , in fact , the third time the h . g . wells story has been brought to the screen . moreau opened in theaters . arguably better than the original , this uses state-of-the-art makeup to augment an adventure that still has time to consider the philosophical implications of its subject matter . and , while it might have been possible to argue the merits of this version of the island of dr . moreau if it had offered something more than the others , the sad truth is that it offers much less . for , while the creatures look better than in even the 1977 version , the heart and soul of the story have been gutted , leaving behind a hollow , chaotic nightmare . somewhere under the debris left by a script credited to four screenwriters lie the remnants of wells' story , but the original tale is distorted and diluted not only by the need to "" modernize "" it , but the desire to emphasize visual effects and pyrotechnics over drama . almost immediately , edward becomes aware that some very strange things are taking place there . steeped in an atmosphere that grows more ominous and eerie with each scene , the first half hour promises far more than what the rest of the production delivers . the film's middle portion , while watchable , makes us aware that the script wasn't written for thinking viewers . it's during the concluding half hour , however , that the movie's house-of-cards storyline collapses . nothing much makes sense , and the climax seems to exist solely as an opportunity to show off a few reasonably impressive explosions . the acting varies from bad to awful . he's only on screen for about fifteen minutes , and , while there , his amazing girth is far more likely to capture our attention than his acting . to be fair , fairuza balk ( gas food lodging ) does a credible job of mixing kittenish and human qualities , but , although she creates the only sympathetic character in the entire film , she is underused . insultingly , frankenheimer concludes the movie with a short sermon about the fine line that separates man from beast . if the director actually wanted to get this point across , he should have worked it into the film rather than tacking it on as an afterthought . it is , after all , an integral aspect of the source material . that it has been so thoroughly excised from the main plot isn't the island of dr . moreau's only problem , but it's symptomatic of the flawed mindset that went into planning this occasionally incoherent and ultimately disappointing motion picture .",0.4

"a movie as a star vehicle is an honored tradition . so in 1967 when still fairly new director franco zeffirelli wanted to make his first big hollywood picture , he cast both richard burton and elizabeth taylor . the film was the taming of the shrew and with superstars like that how could he miss . the acting was sure to be good , and the press would cover every antic on the set thus building up the excitement for its release . the quality of the result is debatable , but one thing is certain , burton and taylor clearly have great fun with their acting assignments . the audience at the six weeks shakespeare festival at san jose's camera three seemed to be having a good time as well . in my judgment shakespearean comedies work best when the directors rely on the words for the humor . this is the path that kenneth branagh chose for much ado about nothing . zeffirelli opted instead for slapstick figuring that the play needed to be jazzed up with many sight gags and general physical comedy . moreover , although the words sound authentic , screenwriters suso cecchi d'amico , paul dehn , and franco zeffirelli seem to have modified a fair amount of the bard's text . i must admit that whenever i see the writing of a movie is done by a committee i take that as a bad omen . the picture is filmed by oswald morris ( academy award winner for fiddler on the roof ) and luciano trasatti in a hazy glow as if through a slightly rose tinted lens . to complement this rosy glow , the academy award nominated sets by john decuir , giuseppe mariani , lorenzo mongiardino , and elven webb look like a disney prototype for a renaissanceland . since zeffirelli viewed the play as a romp , these images help establish the spirit of the film . the story is typical for shakespeare -- full of false identities where people are not who they seem to be . taylor spends most of the first part of the film grunting and throwing things . although by the end the slapstick does subside , we have to endure flying tables of dust and other acts i found lacking in much real humor . zeffirelli also had many filthy servants with bad teeth in his attempt to provide increased mirth . sadly that was not as often as it should have been . taylor is a famous yo-yo dieter , but she was just the right size when the movie was filmed -- certainly not svelte but trim and with an overflowing bosom shown to advantage in the clothes of the period . burton too looks the part of a crude but cunning man . petruchio complains that it is , "" nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat ! "" for the record , my all time favorite shakespeare movie is zeffirelli's romeo and juliet where he plays it straight . not a bad movie , but there is more potential lost than realized . i enjoyed it enough , but i would not want to see it again . the show appears not to be rated , but it would be a pg for some of the bawdy references . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or modern profanity . the show would be fine for kids of any age , but they would probably have to be at least nine to be interested in it . i give the show thumbs up and award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6
"a thoroughly enjoyable claude chabrol detective story , covering ground the director is very familiar with from his previous successes with this kind of a mystery story . the director is in a playful mood and builds a crime scene around kinky characters , hypocrites , lowlifes , and druggies , as he parodies bourgeois life . the film starts with a surprise and ends with a debatable moral ending to the murder case , which is geared to be pleasing to the audience's sense of what is right rather than one that follows the law or the integrity of the inspector's profession . the inspector is the focal point of the film and the way he operates is a rough imitation of sherlock holmes . his reactions to what occurs is how we are led to believe we should see the film . poiret is superb , his dry wit and the persistent way he carries out the investigation , sets the film's laconic tone , setting up the bizarre turn of events in a magnificently comic fashion . this is a purely entertaining film , with no great insights into life , but with some great looks at how absurd life really is . the joy in the film is expressed best through the following actors : the dreamy and soft performance of lafont , the spry and eccentric performance from brialy , who was in a chabrol film some thirty years ago , and from poiret's strongly understated performance , holding back his feelings by letting his action do the talking . this is chabrol at his most playful , which offers some surprises , shocks , and amusement .",0.7

""" take me out to the ball game . take me out to the crowd . buy me some peanuts and crackerjack . i don't care if i ever get back so let's root , root , root for the home team . if they don't win , it's a shame . for it's one . . . two . . . three "" you have everything [in baseball]--the immigrants and the rise of the cities , the racial tension , then the decline of cities and the rise of suburbs , the sun belt , conflicts between management and labor , the birth of popular culture and the media , the cult of heroes and celebrity , the nature of democracy itself . to a large extent , to a really astonishing extent , the story of baseball is the story of this country . "" since its inception in the 1700s as "" townball , "" baseball has been a cultural mirror of the society that spawned it . whether in its early years of organization or in recent times , when superstar's salaries have skyrocketed beyond the $5 million mark , baseball has always held wide popular appeal . more than any other sport , baseball is a game of history and memories . its past is its strength , and understanding its current state requires a probing of all that has gone before . ken burns' mammoth baseball has attempted to do just that--examine the game from its beginnings to the modern day . some have erroneously labeled the movie "" exhaustive "" but , in fact , it's far from that . a truly extensive history of the game would take at least ten times the 18-1/2 hours allotted , and would probably be boring beyond belief . the overall structure is cumbersome , and the tone uneven ( inning nine tries to cover too much ; innings three , five , and six drag noticeably ) , but the game/movie parallelism provides as good a way as any to break the production into manageable pieces . it's difficult to believe that anyone , even the most ardent baseball historian , could sit through all one-thousand one-hundred and thirty minutes straight . following a loving introduction extolling the virtues of baseball , burns explores the game's origins , debunking the myth that abner doubleday had anything to do with its genesis . ( "" say it ain't so , joe ! "" ) with so many players off to fight , however , the talent was thin . the mets had the worst initial season of any 20th century baseball team . baseball's most glaring fault is that it's too long . much too long . certain segments seem to drag interminably with little in the way of color added to the basic historical regurgitation . most of what this series has to offer can be gleaned from a good book on the sport . the analysis is rarely penetrating and the visual elements are typically stale . the moments when baseball shines are too often sandwiched around stretches of dry , straightforward documentary presentation . almost equally disappointing is the film's treatment of the modern era . burns' examination of the '70s and '80s is a spotty , hit-and-miss affair that creates few memorable impressions . baseball is at its strongest when it focuses on one of its three primary themes . the film demonstrates the elasticity of the game's appeal , and you get a sense that no matter how immediately crippling the current players' strike is , the sport will eventually overcome it . the examination of baseball's approach to segregation ( before the mid-'40s ) and integration ( thereafter ) is handled in a thought-provoking and thorough manner . burns' probing of the role of blacks in the sport--both in the negro leagues and later in the major leagues--represents one of the most insightful filmed approaches to the subject . inexplicably , however , the work stoppages of the '70s and '80s are not mentioned . fans in other parts of the country may at times feel slighted , however . and boston , other than being burns' favorite team , is hardly worthy of the amount of exposure it receives . based on relative screen time , one would have to conclude that casey stengel was a more important figure than connie mack , and yogi berra was of greater significance than steve carlton , lou brock , and mike schmidt combined . burns' civil war style of combining photographs with "" talking heads , "" period music , and voiceover quotes doesn't work as well in baseball , perhaps because the emotional resonance achieved here doesn't match that of stories of a nation torn by war . by the middle of the series , film clips are replacing still photographs , making this documentary's overall format seem more traditional than that of its predecessor . the are several noteworthy "" recreations "" of partial or entire games . in the end , a non-baseball fan who sticks with this movie for its entirety is likely to learn a lot about the sport and its history , and perhaps gain an understanding of why it inspires such passion in so many people . and every viewer , devotee or not , is herein given the opportunity to appreciate the unique synergy between the progress of the game and american history . baseball is a canvas painted with broad strokes and little detail . burns has invested an incredible amount of effort and passion into a project that is by turns insightful , nostalgic , pedantic , and ( unfortunately ) occasionally dull . "" i actually think [baseball] still is at the center of our lives in this country . oh , it has periods when it seems to be eclipsed . but baseball has so inserted itself into the american soul . its strength is uniting people , generation after generation . it's suffering from an anxiety about itself . and you know what ? knowing your own history is the best antidote to that confusion .

"it's interesting to note that two of the best films i've seen theatrically in 1996 weren't made this year . in fact , they weren't even made this decade . the first , martin scorsese's classic , taxi driver , is celebrating its twentieth anniversary . championed by scorsese , this re- release was handled by miramax films , which has brought back to the screen one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever to be filmed . purple noon is an autopsy of a near-perfect crime , and a compelling look at the man who commits it . the fee for the job is $5000 , but , once tom becomes involved in phillippe's life , its seductive leisure entices him away from his original goal -- or so it seems . this is all really setup , because the meat of the story reveals that tom is , in fact , an amoral killer , willing to do just about anything to get what he wants . tom is without remorse ; the only emotion he displays is satisfaction at the success of his latest caper . the plot , which is a wonderfully twisty affair filled with ingenious turns , is a delight to watch as it unfolds . nothing about this movie is pedantic or predictable ; it's two hours of pure suspense that puts many of the recent so-called "" thrillers "" to shame . it's a masterful effort by director clement , and , considering the nature of the main character , it's not hard to understand why scorsese would lend his name to the re-release ( much as he did for belle du jour ) . one of purple noon's most obvious assets is delon's acting . tom is fascinating because delon makes him so . this isn't a run-of-the-mill villain ; he's a complex character with a well thought-out reason for everything he does . he may be a psychopath , but there's a quality about him that engrosses and seduces us even as his actions cause repulsion . and , because the movie centers on tom , there are times when we find ourselves hoping that his schemes will work , if only for the pleasure of seeing what he will do next . in addition to delon's fine performance , purple noon is characterized by expert camerawork and crisp direction . clement understands how to sustain tension without drawing it out too far . the film is exactly the right length , as are each of the individual scenes . cinematographer henri decae has composed each of his shots carefully , including a masterful series of closeups of delon's eyes that reveal the sinister intelligence behind the apparently-guileless exterior . with twisters and independence days packing theaters and grabbing headlines , it's easy to bemoan the current state of cinema . so far , 1996 has not been a particularly good year for movies . there's nothing so engrossing as watching a truly intelligent thriller , and that makes this film a rare treat .",0.85

"in the mood for love is a beautifully shot , romantic drama that is unrelentingly sad but touchingly honest . like the age of innocence , the picture which it most resembles , the story tells of two circumspect lovers who have the bad luck to be in love and married , but not to each other . a movie which is perhaps more remarkable for what it doesn't show than what it does , it draws us into its slow rhythms from the first scene . among things left to our imagination are what their much-discussed-but-never-seen spouses are like and what , if any , physical intimacy , other than brief hand caresses , ever takes place between the two lovers . both performances are delicately nuanced and emotionally involving . she is so frozen than she looks like life itself has knocked the breath out of her . writer and director kar-wai wong's last film was happy together , which i hated . this time , however , he comes up with a brilliant script and gets stunning performances out of his stars . a keenly observant film , it has us witnessing much of the action from a distance or from an adjoining room . sometimes , we see one character but not the other in a conversation that takes place across rooms . and , sometimes , the actors leave us in the hallway as they carry on their discussions within our ear range but not within view . the actions -- maybe activities would be a more apt term -- take place in offices as well as apartments , streets and restaurants . this is particularly refreshing since films tend to ignore office locales even though real human beings spend substantial portions of their lives there . mrs . chan's tight-fitting , flowered-print dresses are uniformly alluring and beautiful , whereas mr . chow's thin ties and starched white shirts are unappealingly bland . how far it actually goes is up to the viewer's interpretation . almost the only time that we see more than their hands touch is when mr . chow provides a shoulder for mrs . chan to cry on . but the signs of increasing intimacy are unmistakable , even if modest . it's a small moment , but quite a telling one .

"among the hardest of movies to review are kids' movies like a dog of flanders , which is being made for the fourth time . it's hard to criticize a handsomely shot film full of good moral values even if the cliched story never ventures outside of its predictable parameters . its one "" surprise "" is so obvious that one wonders why they even bother . before even the opening credits roll , the audience witnesses a mother trudging through heavy , blowing snow . with a screenplay by robert singer and the director kevin brodie , a dog of flanders has the look and feel of a television movie , not surprising since almost all of their experience is in television . the excessively earnest tale features a host of dour characters . the story , which takes itself too seriously , needs to lighten up some . as delivered , the movie will have its intended audience of kids aged 4 to 12 , fidgeting and squirming in their seats , which is a shame since the values it tries to teach are so important . not a lot happens and when it does the director substantially mutes its effect . and the editor trims the scenes down to a certain homogenized blandness . you keep feeling that there's a much better story trying hard to get out . although you might think that any movie with a dog in the title would feature , well , a dog , the frisky patrasche doesn't get anywhere near the screen time that he deserves . moreover , he earns a warning in the ending credits as the filmmakers feel compelled to admonish kids that dogs of patrasche's breed , officially known as bouvier des flanders , may not make a suitable pet . what's next ? will credits start warning kids that the villains in the movies may not make appropriate friends ? the script hews carefully to a strict moral code with trite little aphorisms at every turn . one of the story's few evil characters is a landlord who likes to be paid in full .

"vanya on 42nd street may be the most innovative and successful straight film adaptation of any play . eschewing the big-budget options made available through the medium , louis malle's picture opts instead for the exact opposite : an intimate , unassuming view of a run through of david mamet's reworking of anton chekhov's uncle vanya . the manner in which the play is framed is marvelously clever . vanya opens with the various actors and theater director andre gregory walking the streets of new york . when the film transitions from dialogue between the actors to the actual play , the switch is so subtle that it takes the audience a moment to realize what has happened . excepting several transition sequences , the film is chekhov's tale of lost opportunities . those not familiar with uncle vanya will find the story alone a rich and rewarding experience--not only is this a unique adaptation , but it does an excellent job conveying the issues , emotions , and complex characters which make vanya so potent . the familiarity of the cast with the material and each other is apparent in the comfortable manner in which vanya is presented . the play , as is often true of adaptations of chekhov's work , is talky , and the cast is populated with unhappy characters , but that doesn't stop this from being an engrossing and surprisingly humorous tale . the perfectly timed , repeated interjections of "" oh , will you shut up ! "" are responsible for a fair share of laughs . there isn't a weak performance . in fact , there isn't a weak moment . despite its many strengths , however , vanya on 42nd street isn't for everyone . it is , after all , a russian play , with all the qualities ascribed to that storytelling niche . issue-related and character-centered , vanya has what could best be described as a minimalist plot . action-oriented viewers need not bother . nevertheless , for those seeking an amazing stage-to-film epiphany , there is no better choice . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore .",0.8

"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . i spent much of crazy in alabama trying to figure out the connection between its two largely parallel storylines . i spent much of the rest of the time surprised how little i cared . and i spent the final ten minutes marvelling how quickly a pleasant little film can turn ghastly . i must confess that i kept forgiving crazy in alabama its excess just because it was so unexpectedly weird at times , primarily in the lucille-on-the-lam segments . her adventures are so ridiculous it's hard not to smile . the story keeps hopping in so many directions , zestfully directed by banderas , that it's almost impossible to lose interest for long . it also hops back in the direction of peejoe's story , where strangeness generally gives way to sluggish sincerity . crazy in alabama plays its racial themes deadly straight , turning peejoe into a preternaturally wise and moral lad who even gets to shake dr . martin luther king's hand . in more ways than one , it's all black and white -- the buffoonishly nasty sheriff , the calmly liberal father figure , the noble african-american protesters whose plight is rendered in grainy newsreel-style footage . everyone carries on in the expected ways on the expected subjects , all leading to the one-would-hope-obvious conclusion that segregation was a very bad thing indeed , and thank heaven for a few good white people to help set things right . still , the zestful style of the lucille storyline makes it possible to get past the heavy-handedness of the peejoe storyline . . . thus is set in motion one of the most painful courtroom finales in cinema's long , sad history of painful courtroom finales , presided over by rod steiger as the judicial equivalent of col . kurtz . first lucille tells her tale of woe to the jury , rambling on about the horrors of domestic abuse for reasons too contrived to fathom . you'd suspect it was a matter of banderas indulging his real-life leading lady , if not for the fact that steiger follows lucille's monologue with a rant of his own . banderas loses complete control over his actors at the film's conclusion . worse yet , the film takes two sensitive issues -- the subjugation of african-americans and the subjugation of women -- and , in attempting to equate them , doesn't do justice to either one . it's a tragic miscalculation in a film which at least had a chance when it was quirky and frivolous . the real craziness in crazy in alabama is that a viewer might spend so much time giving it the benefit of the doubt . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.4

"the family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be , and the philosophical lines they spout , in this slow-moving , almost actionless film for this genre , sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to it , one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous criminals , as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral . this is the most powerful scene in the film and it is brilliantly accomplished . but the film can't end on that prosaic note , this film is heading down a more philosophical and catholic path , as the end is so unexpected and makes so little sense , no matter how you try to explain it , that we can only guess what the director means . the picture works despite the bizarre ending , because it is gritty and seems real , in the sense that so many families are dysfunctional in america , that there is no reason why a long-standing mob family shouldn't also be plagued with family problems . chris penn's performance earned him the "" best supporting actor "" award at the 1996 venice film festival and the film won the special jury prize . but i didn't think he was something special , as much as he gave the film energy . the gallo character , despite a lot of attention placed on it , is never uncovered , and his performance only seemed adequate . he has a great line , though , where he says , "" life is pointless without the movies .

"in most movies , friendships are the equivalent of cinematic side orders . especially in contemporary productions , almost every main character has to have a best friend . this facilitates character development and allows secondary interaction . rarely , however , is friendship the point of a movie . that's not the case in the object of my affection , which , although it is a little about sex and love , is much more about the undemanding , casual affection that builds between real friends . the chemistry between aniston and rudd is perfect in establishing this relationship . they have a real camaraderie which is only occasionally spiced up by a hint of sexual tension . jennifer aniston's movie career has proceeded along an interesting trajectory . she broke into the big screen business in leprechaun , a low-budget horror flick that she would probably prefer to forget about . in her first feature starring role , picture perfect , she showed hints of the charisma that has earner her a legion of loyal fans , but not until the object of my affection has she truly sparkled . as nina , aniston not only displays a surprising capacity for both comedy and drama , but she shines with the kind of star quality that only a handful of current performers exhibit . the object of my affection is clearly better because of her , not in spite of her . this isn't a standout performance , but rudd is good enough to convince us that his character feels genuine affection for nina . alan alda , who has a supporting part as nina's brother-in-law , provides a fair share of humor in an openly-comic role . and nigel hawthorne once again proves his strength as an actor by fashioning a memorable individual out of what is little more than a bit part . hawthorne's rodney fraser is the kind of sad , lonely man who effortlessly captures one's pity . many aspects of the object of my affection are not new to movies . in fact , the central theme , which struggles with the similarities and differences between sexual and platonic love , has been more fully explored in recent historical features like carrington and mrs . the one thing that all of these films have over the object of my affection is an edge ? each of them tries something a little unconventional and risky , while this movie attempts to be a crowd-pleaser . this is apparently director nicholas hytner's push to make a mainstream hollywood movie . the respected british director , whose best- known effort is probably the madness of king george , has a keen sense of character and a good feel for the details of a friendship , and these are the reasons why the object of my affection , which has a pleasant ( but not superlative ) script , work . for , while many of the secondary relationships are sketchily-developed and occasionally hard-to-swallow , the connection between george and nina is so strong and believable that it draws us into their world and allows us to root for the seemingly- improbable happy ending .

"unless infused with some sort of unique energy , road pictures have become a worn-out genre , as proved by father hood . it's a mystery to me why films like this get made . do we really need to spend ninety minutes following the misadventures of two children and an adult ( who often displays less maturity than his offspring ) as they run around the country trying to get to know one another ? how many hundreds of movies and television shows have had the same plot ? there is little to relieve the tedium of this film , except an impressive performance by little-known actress sabrina lloyd . unfortunately , this is not the movie anyone wants to have it said that they gave their most memorable performance in . if i had cared about the characters , perhaps the unbelievable number of plot implausibilities wouldn't have bothered me as much , but no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of sympathy , especially not jack , who is an annoying , arrogant jerk . give patrick swayze credit ( if you want to call it that ) for playing this guy with the right amount of sleaze to get the audience to actively dislike him . the two kids have their moments . actually , i should say that lloyd's kelly has her moments . eddie , as played by brian bonsall , a young actor of limited appeal and talent , is pretty much a nonentity . the script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing with them , and that immediately put me on guard . movies of substance rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery . small roles are given to notables like diane ladd and michael ironside , but these two hardly have more than a few moments on screen . halle berry , who's given second billing behind swayze , doesn't have a role that's much more significant . it's an understatement to say that her talent is wasted . on top of all this , as if sitting through this movie isn't a bad enough experience in the first place , the film makers manage to steal away any possible tension through their structuring of the story . father hood comes complete with a social message that's as old as dickens' oliver twist . while i would support a movie that grapples with the problem sensitively and intelligently , this is not that film . it takes a good- guy , bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer's emotions , not make him or her think about the seriousness of what's going on . in fact , the low quality of father hood may actually sabotage the message it's trying to get across . that too was a road film featuring an older , somewhat callous guardian and the two children he was entrusted with . the similarities extend no further than plot structure and character background , because il ladro di bambini is an excellent movie , and viewing it makes the faults of father hood seem that much more glaring . there may not have been many like me , but i was actually impressed by patrick swayze's performance in city of joy . but with the release of this example of ugliness , i may have to admit to being mistaken . and "" mistake "" is a key word here , because that's exactly what this entire production is .",0.33

"director : bille august . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 131 minutes . i've been hearing people refer to the new film adaptation of les miserables as "" lay miz , "" which goes to show what the common frame of reference is going to be . that abbreviated moniker comes , of course , from alain boublil and claude-michel schonberg's immensely popular musical adaptation , which has been selling out theaters around the world for over a decade . they know all this not so much because they are familiar with victor hugo's novel , but because of that musical with its signature waif-and-tricolor iconography . bille august's straightforward rendering of les miserables makes you realize exactly why the story works so well as grand opera . the film is certainly faithful to most basic events of the novel , though it cuts certain characters entirely and chops other encounters down to a bare minimum . it's not textual fidelity which is lacking in les miserables ; it's emotional scope . virtually every scene feels muted , the passions tamed to a state of dignified dissatisfaction . what les miserables really needed was for someone , anyone , to break into song . the stage production captured the sweeping melodrama of hugo brilliantly -- the battles carried a tragic grandeur , the conflicts shook the foundations of society , and the deaths were moments to jerk tears from the driest eyes . there is no substitute for the kind of dramatic economy music or a well-constructed song can provide ; three minutes of furtive conversation between cosette and marius ( hans matheson ) can't create nearly the convincing sense of love at first sight that three minutes of "" in my life "" does . the film seems to have been crafted and edited strictly to make sure certain necessary plot details were included , with little interest in building momentum towards a cathartic release . from a certain standpoint -- one with no musical preconceptions in the way -- les miserables is perfectly effective as period drama , and a fine introduction to the classic story . technical credits are first rate , with costumes by the gifted gabriella pesucci ( the age of innocence ) and effective recreations of 19th century paris . the exceptional cast does generally sharp work , particularly rush in a more interesting and subtle performance than his oscar-winning showcase of tics and flourishes in shine . often , however , it feels as though august is keeping them all on a leash , eschewing musical theater in favor of "" masterpiece theater .

"the quirky duo who hung around in the background of kevin smith's 1994 debut feature , clerks , have returned to the screen for the followup , mallrats , the middle picture of the so-called "" new jersey trilogy . "" in many ways , this new movie is a less original , not-as-funny , full color redressing of clerks . despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio , mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film . their role here is a little more prominent than in their previous outing , and about half of mallrats' best humor is centered around them . they're involved in quite a bit of road runner/wylie coyote slapstick which , while obviously juvenile , is still hilarious . the script for mallrats is rather disjointed and episodic . although smith's knack for insightful comic dialogue is much in evidence , many of the lines aren't the equal of those in clerks for cleverness or humor . and , the less funny the dialogue is , the more stilted and unnatural it seems . there are several painfully awkward "" dead spots "" in mallrats where nothing works--not the dialogue , the acting , or the direction . pop references abound with as much regularity as the jokes ( sometimes they are the jokes ) . these range from nods to classic movies ( sundance in butch cassidy and the sundance kid ) , star wars , and '80s teen farces ( such as those directed by john hughes ) to comic book characters , "" the dating game "" , and ( inevitably , given shannen doherty's presence ) a certain current tv show with a zip code in the title . smith is aware that there is a niche audience for mallrats--the under-30 crowd . as a result , the film plays almost exclusively to this group , and comes across as a grungy , male version of clueless . there is such a thing as the "" sophomore jinx "" for film makers . smith freely admits that he toned down the script and broadened the comedy in a quest for wider appeal , and allows that mallrats is a far less "" cerebral "" film than clerks . time , of course , will tell , but as long as jay and silent bob are around , future efforts can't be all that bad--or , for that matter , all that deep .",0.67

"cecilia roth , the wonderful argentinian-born actress , is the focal point of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of motherhood . in this film there is little difference between what is real and what is fake . this is the 13th pedro almod ? var film i have seen , one that many critics say shows the aging , enfant terrible director maturing , becoming kinder and gentler , showing a capacity for making a film with more of a conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as he once loved to do . but the shock is still there , enough of it to keep it from becoming a mainstream film . to visually show her path back and forth from barcelona to madrid , there is a stunningly photographed tunnel looking very much like a womb , with a train racing through it . though the film has a pungency to it , there are just too many scenes where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the story . the film is filled with many references and homages to other hollywood films and to writers , something that is both good and bad . it is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual influences . bad because the references are overused here , making the director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds . but he doesn't know that . this is a story about many different things : its subplots could take you into areas such as organ donors , aids , coincidences , family relationships , family values , and the affects of pop culture on the public ( take note of that hilarious diaper commercial , an actual one shown on spanish tv ) ; but , the film's main premises were about : praising actresses , praising motherhood , praising sexual ambiguity , and praising the kindness from strangers ( tolerance of all people seems to be the strongest message emanating from the film ) . the mixed feelings i got about the film come from my not being sure if this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera . there were times i didn't know whether i was supposed to laugh at all this or cry . this film is melodramatic in the tradition of the douglas sirk nuclear family romantic rock hudson and dorothy malone ones of the 1950s , but with almod ? var , it becomes even a weepier one , one that is mostly outrageous , one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not nuclear . it is a film that is paradoxical : men can be actresses also . the deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are simply dazzling . this film could be enjoyed solely for its bright orange , red and yellow patterns , giving the eye a startling light show to feast on , as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty to another . it is worth noting , that there is no criticism by the director for any of his characters , no matter how they screw things up . the problem with all this adulation is that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it , it is just too good to be true , and his characters are not completely believable because of this . the film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters ; their close-ups revealing an inner strength in them , that no matter what they've been through , they will stick together and not succumb to their overwhelming problems . a pregnant nun in an almod ? var film shouldn't be that surprising to his fans , in fact what else should they expect ! this is another of the director's themes , of how the ones who are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression , are really fakes , while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in society , could be the normal ones , who are at least living out their fantasies . the hurt look on rosa's face after her father leaves , gives us a picture of her thought process that is better than dialogue , it is one that is worth savoring . there is one scene when agrado announces that the performance of "" streetcar . . . "" of course , this clears most of the audience out , with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring ones , the same audience that has sustained the director over the years . she proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much each part cost , in a comic bit that seemed , at least it did to me , that the director was trying to please his audience too much . trying the actors were all splendid . i was particularly impressed by marisa paredes' subtle but invigorating performance . the aging actress had a certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in , showing how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is . but when the spotlight was on marisa , what the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it that didn't seem forced . but still , what makes an almod ? var film special , is his eye for visual effects . i haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year ( it is comparable to kubrick's "" eyes wide shut "" ) . i was so dazzled by the visuals , that the film's metaphors , bizarre tale , and great actors , seem to take second place to the visual splendor of the film . as good as this film is , one of the problems almod ? var still has , is that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from caricatures . this cloy act of his does not make agrado any more compelling . one must give almod ? var credit for getting his voice heard in the mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact . that is not an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary references to it , despite the differences i have with his approach to the characters and their development . the film's story line is ludicrous but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real . almod ? var retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre , that keeps the film from descending toward being a hollywood one . but it also never reaches great artistic heights . there are no breakthroughs in character study . this is basically still a message film . a most amusing and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous , but not a great film . the critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows , when the 'chic' cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen as the best one in the festival , but cheered when almod ? var won for best director , they now might be considered as part of the usual almod ? var fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers , a fan base that seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast , one that is more establishment orientated .",0.7
"poetry is the vehicle of choice for how the story is best transcribed onscreen , since dialogue is almost non-existent . it is told as if time doesn't exist , one event runs into another and everything seems jumbled . images of water and fire are used throughout the film for purposes of symbolically cleansing the soul and destroying the impurities in it . paint is used as a contrast to blood . in a film loaded with contrasts , the huge gap between most of the population which is poor , is harshly contrasted with those who have money to burn . innocence is being corrupted by the experienced , proving that nothing remains pure in this city that steals one's life , one's poetry , and one's spirit . which signifies that there is something despairing about the foreign influence in vietnam , but what that despair exactly means , is never clearly stated in the context of the story . he somehow keeps her a virgin by having her do all the kinky sex tricks that do not involve touching , like peeing for a customer . this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell . but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is . also , it seemed to me , there were too many violent scenes , as the filmmaker seems to revel in them without expounding on them . this powerful film offers westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a third world country , a country most americans only envision in a depersonalized way , but the film still had too many gaps in its storytelling and too many loose ends it left not fully developed . cyclo , as a person , should have been more flesh-and-blood like , rather than used as merely a morbid symbolic example of the loss of innocence . there was something there that just seemed to be elusive about the film , the director just wouldn't let the viewer get into without imposing his own personal barriers ; he doesn't even want to give us their real names , as if he thought , we would sully their hardships even more than it already is . he mainly wants to shock our sensibilities , to have us look plaintively at his native country like he does , even if he too is only a tourist . there is nothing wrong with that in itself , but his social designs could have been painted with clearer brush strokes . the contrast between those who are gentle and those who are brutal , and those who are dreamers and those who can't dream anymore , could have been better utilized than to point out the obvious , of how wretched a place this is and of how the gentle ( innocent ) have little chance of succeeding . still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion . cyclo was a deserved winner of a golden lion award for best film at the venice film festival .",0.7
"for the movie's 60th anniversary , disney has devised an almost all-new film ; only mickey's famous "" sorcerer's apprentice "" segment remains . fantasia , perhaps cinema's most beloved musical montage , has not merely been updated . it has an entirely new medium for its latest incarnation . disney decided that they would shoot it in imax , a format normally reserved for films in which the viewers vicariously risk their lives climbing mountains ( everest ) or riding roller coasters ( thrill ride ) . the resulting film , fantasia/2000 , is a real treat for the ears . it is in the visuals that the movie comes up so short that it has to be labeled a disappointment . given the three-dimensional realism that we've seen this past year from disney ( tarzan ) , pixar/disney ( toy story 2 ) and other studios ( the princess mononoke ) , most of the illustrations in fantasia/2000 look flat and uninviting by comparison . then there is the choice of imax as the medium , which might seem a cute idea but turns out to be a fundamental mistake . blown up several stories high , the animation's flaws are magnified . what should be compelling instead turns out to be too busy and garish as gigantic images flash across the screen . mickey's segment , especially , suffers by being stretched . why they didn't repaint the colors is a mystery because it leaves this episode looking needlessly dated due to its grainy texture . when it ends , they cut to a properly colored mickey , which just emphasizes the inadequate restoration of the original portion . fantasia/2000 isn't a bad movie , just one with so much potential that it causes you to dwell on its flaws . take the whale sequence . as these beautiful animals frolic and splash in the ocean , the director decided not to include any sound effects . normally such a scene would have had some realistic water sounds overlaid with the music . without them , the piece has a strangely remote and detached feeling . go in with low expectations , try not to be too demanding when it comes to the animation and fantasia/2000 will prove a pleasant enough experience . just try to forget how good it could and should have been . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages , although many kids will be bored as there is little plot to hold their attention . my son jeffrey , age 10 , liked the movie enough to give it * * 1/2 . it was so different for him that he didn't know quite what to make of it or how to rate it . he liked most of the segments , except the ending one , which he found too fast and confusing .",0.6
"the production notes trumpet the matchmaker as "" a romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies . "" this statement implies that the film has something exceptionally original or daring to offer those who are tired of screen love affairs that follow a predictable trajectory from point a to point b . in fact , it's false advertising . there's nothing remotely special about the romantic component of this picture -- it's strictly boy meets girl , boy loses girl due to a silly misunderstanding , and boy gets back together with girl in time for the end credits . so why would anyone who hates romantic comedies like this one ? presumably because the film makers believe that janeane garofalo is the type of atypical leading lady who will attract a more cynical audience . indeed , she shows the same unselfconscious charm in the matchmaker that made her character so irresistible in cats and dogs . the primary difference is that the script for this film has a confused sense of what it wants to accomplish , and , as a result , director mark joffe ( cosi ) is unable to utilize garofalo's talents fully . the film begins conventionally enough . unfortunately , instead of just allowing the story to coast along through familiar romantic comedy terrain , the film makers choose to bring back the political sideshow during the final half-hour . this might have been okay had the material been well-written , but it's all trite and derivative . the matchmaker's script doesn't offer one observation about the american political process that hasn't been presented many times before , frequently in better movies . worse still , as this aspect of the plot attains pre- eminence during the closing twenty minutes , marcy and her romantic situation are crowded out . maybe the reason romantic comedy haters are supposed to appreciate this film is because , after a hour's buildup , the love story gets shortchanged . also , since the movie was shot on location in ireland , a dash of the local color and scenery gets thrown into the mix , and there don't seem to be as many stereotypes as one might normally expect from a production of this nature . however , while the romantic stuff here works , the unsavvy and unappealing political material proves to be a constant irritant ( and leads to the film's worst moment -- a short , preachy speech on ethics delivered in strident tones by garofalo ) . as a result , the movie's marriage of true love and cynical campaigning turns out to be less than a match made in heaven .

"" that's probably why can't hardly wait feels so much like a greatest hits compilation , peppered with recognizable elements from the entire hughes oeuvre of the mid-80s and a dozen other teen comedies of the last 25 years for good measure . that's one hefty dose of deja-vu , enough to overwhelm most films this slight . fortunately , kaplan and elfont prove as adept at entertaining as they are at reminiscing . can't hardly wait may be familiar and predictable , but it's never out-and-out dumb , and at times it's surprisingly funny . the appealing cast features solid work from lauren ambrose as vulnerable wiseacre denise and seth green as a tries-too-hard homeboy with whom she ends up locked in a bathroom . some of the forced whimsy does fall flat ( notably jenna elfman's cameo as an "" angel "" offering advice to the lovelorn preston ) , and kaplan and elfont probably toss a few too many pop culture references on the fire . for once , however , the problems in a teen comedy spring from over-writing rather than under-writing . if there's one noteworthy hole in can't hardly wait , it's the central plot of preston's pursuit of amanda . ethan embry is pleasant enough in an unrequited puppy-dog way , but this is the kind of role john cusack defined a decade ago ; you root for preston not because his entire demeanor sells his longing , but because the machinations of the plot point you in that direction . of all the plot threads running through can't hardly wait , theirs is by far the least interesting , though it's the one inevitably destined to provide the happy ending . still , it's hard not to find charms in a teen comedy that's lively , moderately intelligent and effective in its portrayal of high school social dynamics . it also features a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack which runs the gamut from guns 'n' roses to smashmouth , from third eye blind to run-dmc , from parliament to the title tune by the replacements . can't hardly wait even manages to include a bit of social commentary in its adolescent craziness , promoting environmental awareness , safe sex and responsible drinking and driving behavior . sure , the latter is emphasized when party attendees drop their car keys into a bowl , which is yet another detail swiped from say anything . can't hardly wait shows off its antecedents unabashedly , and still comes up with something satisfying on its own level . looks like john hughes didn't have to worry about telling a generation of movie-goers "" don't you forget about me .

"cast : damon wayans , adam sandler , james caan , james farentino , kristen wilson , bill nunn , mark roberts director : ernest dickerson producers : robert simonds screenplay : lewis colick , joe gayton cinematography : steven bernstein music : elmer bernstein u . s . distributor : universal pictures on paper , it sounds like a strange idea : damon wayans and adam sandler paired in a 48 hours/lethal weapon-type buddy/action film . of course , this isn't the first time two comic actors have done this sort of thing ( for a recent example , recall martin lawrence and will smith in the better-to-be-forgotten bad boys ) , and , to be fair , wayans has previously appeared in shoot-'em-ups ( like the last boy scout , opposite bruce willis ) . surprisingly , however , this unlikely match works , due primarily to the charisma of both participants . what doesn't hold up , however , is the ho-hum storyline that wayans and sandler find themselves stranded in . universal pictures has labeled bulletproof as a "" comedy action film "" , and that's precisely what it is . the problem is , while some of the humor is very funny , there's nothing remotely interesting about the action stuff . it's all redundant and recycled , with a few feeble riffs added in a failed attempt to give things an original look . the only thing to elevate the material slightly is the use of more elaborate jokes than the one-line wisecracks that permeate the genre . a secondary aspect of the film concentrates on the consequences of betrayal , and , while this subject matter is handled somewhat haphazardly , there is a nice little twist that emphasizes it . at times , bulletproof delights in parodying action staples , which makes it all the more disappointing that the film ultimately relies on so many of them in a straightforward , traditional fashion . the homoerotic subtext apparent in many "" buddy movies "" is toyed with in an inoffensive , over-the-top fashion , as is the formula necessitating that the bad guy has a mole working in the police department . and , if you've seen the previews , you know how funny adam sandler's off-key rendition of "" i'll always love you "" ( from the bodyguard ) is . that , and the entire sequence surrounding it , represents bulletproof's indisputable high point . sandler and wayans work so well together that a future teaming ( with a more daring script ) would be welcome . he may not be losing interest in this kind of role , but i'm getting bored of seeing him do it . then there's kristin wilson , who , aside from her gorgeous eyes , brings little to the tired love interest role . largely because it provoked a few hearty laughs , i found myself enjoying bulletproof more than i expected . with a little extra imagination invested in the action elements , this could have been a worthwhile "" popcorn "" endeavor . as things are , it's a marginal feature likely to appeal to those who don't demand much from their comedy action films . anyone hoping for something more meaty will find that bulletproof has a few too many holes .",0.55
"as directed by john singleton ( rosewood ) , the remake of shaft far surpasses the original , which starred richard roundtree . the movie is a perfect summer film , completely enjoyable with lots of action . like the old westerns , this popcorn movie features a good guy who kills bad guys left and right without worrying about any rules . criminals in shaft don't have any miranda rights or any other rights for that matter . the film's body count is in the dozens since shaft doesn't shoot to wound , and he certainly doesn't miss . when you mention shaft , most people just think of its theme music , which this remake uses to advantage . besides opening with the theme to get us in the mood , it cuts back to it periodically to reenergize us . of course , with action this lively , it isn't clear that we ever need our batteries recharged . the simple plot has two major threads . christian bale , last seen chillingly as patrick bateman in american psycho , is perfectly cast as walter , a depraved preppie . since bale is so good at playing nefarious characters , my single complaint about the picture is that we did not get to see more of walter's villainy . wright delivers a fascinating performance that manages to become even more mesmerizing by his godfather-like speech . with a thick accent and talking like he has marbles in his mouth , wright crafts a unique character . don't be surprised if wright is talked up for an oscar nomination for his supporting role . but along the way , if dozens of criminals have to die , well that's the way it is in the old west or in the ghetto . some movies stretch our imagination and build our intellect . some just give us a good old-fashioned time at the theater . shaft is happy just to do the latter . shaft may not tax your brain , but it will tickle your funny bone and give you ample opportunity to cheer the good guys and hiss the bad . it's pure , unadulterated fun . it is rated r for strong violence and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers .",0.7
"if you turn on the evening news these days , one of the first images you're likely to see will originate from the devastated former yugoslavia , where centuries-old hatreds have boiled over to ignite a scenario of unspeakable horror . yet the sights of bosnia , presented by tv as gruesomely tantalizing tidbits of violence and death , rarely provoke a reaction from the casual viewer . that's how it has always been with television news programs , however -- their coverage of any event , designed for those with limited attention spans , is superficial in the extreme . it's nearly impossible to generate any strong feeling for a situation , no matter how cruel or inhumane it is , when all you get is a quick series of mtv-like clips . so , when it comes to the weightier matters of life , movies often step in where "" real life "" television leaves off . films like the killing fields , apocalypse now , platoon , beyond rangoon , heaven and earth , before the rain , cry the beloved country , schindler's list , and dozens of others have gone "" behind the scenes "" of a news story to animate it , often in gut-wrenching detail . sure , all those motion pictures are , to one degree or another , fictionalized accounts of war and/or social injustice , but they give form to the tragedy . through their characters , who come to mean something to the viewer , the indifferent images of tv take on a personal aspect . this is exactly the intent of vukovar poste restante , a rare , even-handed account of the conflict ripping apart bosnia . this tale of loss , anguish , horror , and futility is powerful beyond words . now , fewer than 3000 survivors remain . it's a sobering consideration to recognize that the background of this picture is not a movie set . often during vukovar , the line between documentary and fiction becomes very blurred . make no mistake , however -- vukovar is not a sterile examination of the evils of war , nor is it a political diatribe . at times , the musical score is almost operatic in nature , borrowing heavily from , among others , mozart . for ana , it is a time of great personal loss . but the film makers hail from bosnia , and vukovar has no more joy in it than current events permit . it is a grim story , but hardly more so than schindler's list . the biggest difference , of course , is the separate historical contexts into which the films fit : the reality of schindler's list is past ; the reality of vukovar goes on , and , if this movie and the short tv news snippets can be believed , the end may not be as close as the signing of a peace treaty . distributors like miramax and fine line have shied away from vukovar , fearing a repeat of what occurred with 1995's before the rain , a similarly-themed movie that died at the box office . but vukovar is a far more devastating experience , and those who do not avoid emotionally- draining features should rejoice that this one , a film festival darling ( twelve awards in thirty-five entries ) , will receive national distribution ( albeit of a limited sort ) . a stunning composition of fact and fiction , vukovar deserves every accolade it collects . yet perhaps the most telling point is that nearly every showing concludes with a nonplused audience sitting in unbroken silence through the end credits .",0.93
"i'll admit that i didn't rent the original psycho last night so i could make my shot-by-shot comparison with a fresh memory . i'm fairly certain hitchcock didn't make it explicit that master bates was masturbating while watching marion crane disrobe , the opening helicopter shot was definitely new , and i can't recall near-subliminal shots of gathering storm clouds edited into the legendary "" shower scene . "" otherwise , everything appeared pretty consistent with my recollection . director gus van sant -- for reasons he has given anywhere from "" why not remake a good film instead of a bad film ? "" to just plain "" why not ? "" -- had indeed taken one of american cinema's most iconic horror films , dipped it in color , and served it up whole to a new generation of movie-goers . the metronomic repetition of "" why "" is a bit futile at this point , but i'm willing to hazard my own guess as to the answer : van sant wanted to remind viewers what a brilliant director alfred hitchcock was , and what a brilliant example of direction psycho was in particular . i hope viewers ( and critics ) don't fold their arms in indignation so tightly against their chests that they fail to recognize how incredibly suspenseful and tautly paced the first hour of this psycho is . heretical though it may seem to say so , the first half of this psycho is better than the original , because heche's interpretation of marion is better than janet leigh's . the staging -- hitch's ominous angles , bernard herrmann's chilling score -- masterfully builds the tension , but it also allows us watch heche's mind work , and she's as fiercely intelligent an actress as we have today . while the narrative is focused on marion's flight , it really flies . there's nothing exactly wrong with vaughn's performance , which is edgy and scary . towering over every other actor in the piece , his good looks untamed by a bad haircut , vaughn is far too physically intimidating to play the meek , sexually repressed basket case . he throws the entire second half of the film out of whack , leaving the audience with nothing to do but watch van sant and his cast play out the rest of the film . there are any number of reasons why a psycho nearly 40 years removed from the well-known original can't work quite as well . the shower scene is now a film-school standby as minutely dissected as the zapruder film , not a viscerally shocking surprise ; familiarity with the true nature of norman's "" mother "" makes some of his dialogue unintentionally humorous . but there's no question that it does still work as an example of building terror through film-making skill . it also shows that the success of particular choices may be built around the casting . the best choice with anthony perkins as norman does not equal the best choice with vince vaughn as norman -- it's chaos theory at its finest applied to the art of directing . this incarnation of psycho isn't a forgery of a great work of art . it's more like a photo of a great work in an art history textbook -- a bit flat , but intriguing enough to make you want to get a better look at the real thing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"starring : andrew robertson , charlotte gainsbourg , alice coultard , ned birkin , sinead cusack director : andrew birkin producers : bee gilbert and ene vanaveski screenplay : andrew birkin based on the novel by ian mcewan music : edward shearmer released by october films considering the rancid , nightmarish quality of his books , it's somewhat amazing that a writer like british author ian mcewan could have three of his works filmed by now . the most controversial of these , however , is the cement garden , principally because of its subject matter : teenage incest . don't expect this film to spare the audience . those unaware of what they're going to see may be violently disturbed by what appears on the screen . there is no moral to this tale , and morality is shown to be relative . in other words , "" good "" does not necessarily triumph over "" evil "" , and no fire explodes from the heavens to sear the sinners . an entire family is together at the outset of the film , but not for long . the incest issue is dealt with in a straightforward and non-prurient fashion . director andrew birkin is not attempting to shock his audience , but rather to candidly represent the factors that lead to this relationship . his style is sensitive , not exploitative , which makes all the difference to the success of the cement garden . the film works because the characters are alive . as dark as the subject matter is ( and i haven't even discussed the meaning of the title ) , birkin still culls laughs from his audience . this isn't the nervous tittering of uncomfortable viewers , but a genuine reaction to amusing moments . much of the humor is relatively harmless , although a few of the jokes ( especially the double entendres ) are off- color . julie is a more likeable character than her brother , but only because it's difficult to love a narcissist . andrew robertson and charlotte gainsbourg have difficult roles to play - their characters require a nakedness that goes beyond the physical to an emotional level . the success of the actors becomes a key element in the film's overall triumph . the cement garden makes no apologies - not to its characters or to the audience . the quality of fascination is as much a credit to those producing the film as to the unorthodox - and grim - central theme . the cement garden is occasionally grotesque , frequently disturbing , and at times surprisingly humorous . no matter what else it may be , however , this movie is always thought-provoking , and it's hard to imagine anyone leaving without the strongest of opinions .",0.83
"in motion pictures , there are essentially three types of satire : a fatuous , silly kind that emphasizes jokes to the exclusion of all else ; a lightly comic approach that gently pokes fun at issues while developing a plot and characters ; and a vicious , unrelenting attack that uses gallows humor to obtain laughs . it's a dark , dark comedy that ruthlessly skewers the news industry on a stake , then roasts it alive . network is brilliant , but it's not very funny in the conventional sense . those looking for a bellyful of laughs would do better renting something else . this movie has its share of amusing moments , but the comedy is so bleak that it's best appreciated on the intellectual level . i can envision a viewer chuckling grimly and nodding his or her head at some of network's nastiest barbs ; i can't see this movie causing anyone to collapse in a paroxysm of laughter the way this is spinal tap does . network is best enjoyed for what it is -- a blistering social commentary that uses exaggeration to make its point . terms that should not be used to describe it : "" light , "" "" breezy , "" "" inconsequential , "" "" amiable , "" "" pleasant , "" and "" hilarious . "" "" i'm going to blow my brains out right here on this program , "" he states . while beale is all-too-happy to be a part of christensen's vision , schumacher , a proponent of the "" hard news "" approach , is less thrilled . beale's message becomes too depressing for the public . the final scene of network is intended to be frankly shocking . and , when the movie was released in 1976 , it was . since then , however , television in general , and the news in particular , has become so openly grotesque and sensationalistic that network's finale seems more credible than appalling . if you doubt this , consider the case of pennsylvania state treasurer r . budd dwyer . everyone in the broadcast industry recognizes this , and so does most of the public , so it's not exactly a revolutionary concept . what's unique is the film's outrageous approach to the subject . and network doesn't just stop with the numbers -- it delves into the reasons why certain programs do better than others and what the viewing public really wants ( which is often very different from what they say they want ) . with an unblinking frankness that is sometimes uncomfortable , network examines three undeniable characteristics of tv viewers : a love of scandal , a taste for anything lurid or shocking , and a short attention span . more than 20 years ago , director sidney lumet and writer paddy chayefsky possessed a prophetic vision -- it's almost as if they saw jerry springer and jenny jones coming . network is not a perfect film . there are times when the pacing is uneven ( i have always been curious about what was cut from the final version ) . a little too much time is occupied by a subplot involving the development of an hour long entertainment show based on the exploits of a group of terrorists ( complete with a not-so-subtle patty hearst lampoon ) . on balance , those are small complaints , and they do little to mar network's brilliant shine . network was brought to the screen by a film maker with a tremendous track record , and this was undoubtedly one of his greatest success stories . while i won't go so far as to claim that network is lumet's best effort , it ranks alongside dog day afternoon ( also about the corruption of the media ) as one of his most acid and pointed social commentaries . an oscar-winner for stalag 17 , holden went on to star in such memorable films as sunset boulevard , bridge on the river kwai , and the wild bunch . here , as the morally-burdened max schumacher , holden brings depth and feeling to a crucial role , adroitly treading the line separating the starry-eyed idealist from the uncaring pragmatist . schumacher is the character in network that the audience most identifies with , and holden's near-perfect performance is one reason why . her character is smart , manipulative , cold , and oh-so-sexy . schumacher offers this pointed description of his lover : "" i'm not sure she's capable of any real feelings . alongside roles in bonnie & clyde and chinatown , dunaway's performance in network remains among her most accomplished . it's easy to see what schumacher saw in christensen , even though he knew who and what she was -- she's as easy to love as she is to hate . the actor's performance is masterful , as he essays a man on the cusp of desperation and madness . finch gives beale his power and charisma , making it possible to understand how a nationwide audience could be captivated by this latter-day evangelist . the supporting cast is no less impressive . robert duvall plays the calculating head of ubs -- a man determined to lift the struggling network from the mire it has slipped into . one passionate monologue in the second half of the film gained her the award . in total , network garnered 10 oscar nominations ; it walked away with four wins ( actor -- finch , actress -- dunaway , supporting actress - - straight , and screenplay ) . yet the awards are nothing more than a testimony to network's strength as both a film and a satire about the realities of television and the relationship between news and entertainment . this is lumet's message to the audience , and it , like network , is just as pertinent today as it was in 1976 . in fact , a case could be made that the movie works better when viewed in the '90s , because things that seemed far-fetched 20 years ago aren't nearly as unbelievable today . one wonders if , in another few decades , a future generation will look at this film and guess whether it was "" based on a true story .

"a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's "" the conversation "" and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked .",0.4
"with a legion of titles like pet sematary , firewalker , sleepwalkers , maximum overdrive , and children of the corn , it's reasonable not to expect much from stephen king-inspired motion pictures . adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable . there are a few notable exceptions , however ; two of which ( stand by me , misery ) were crafted by widely-respected director rob reiner . while the shawshank redemption is not a reiner movie per se , it is a production of castle rock pictures ( reiner's film company ) , and ranks among the best filmed versions of any king stories to date . as one of the characters puts it : "" these [prison] walls are funny . what little color there is , is drab and lifeless ( lots of grays and muted greens and blues ) , and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white ( give credit to cinematographer roger deakins , a longtime cohen brothers collaborator ) . it's ironic , therefore , that the central messages are of hope , redemption , and salvation . first time feature director frank darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances . his unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others , and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly . his is the narrative voice and , for once , the disembodied words aid , rather than intrude upon , the story . whitmore's brooks is a brilliantly-realized character , and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of shawshank represents one of the film's most moving--and effective--sequences . unfortunately , following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama , the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement . the too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly , and writer/director darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package . it is the presentation of this theme that makes the shawshank redemption unique . while this film includes those elements , it makes them peripheral . the shawshank redemption is all about hope and , because of that , watching it is both uplifting and cathartic .",0.85

"but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as "" aliens "" and "" the fly ( 86 ) , "" but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself .",0.7

"screenplay : bruce a . evans and raynold gideon . director : john pasquin . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . whenever film fans learn of plans by an american studio to re-make a foreign language film , the common reaction is a collective cringe . wonderful foreign films like the vanishing and diabolique have been turned into big-budget garbage , as hollywood tends to grab on to a plot without grasping the point . the 1996 american theatrical release of little indian inspired some of the most savage reviews of the year , making the prospect of the disney-fied version jungle 2 jungle almost too much to bear . hollywood could only improve on the original this time around , but it hasn't improved enough . jungle 2 jungle is a dopey and predictable family comedy which could be thought of as disappointing , if not for the wretchedness of the source material . yes , you read correctly , the russian mafia . there is a lot of going on to keep everyone busy , but even at its busiest jungle 2 jungle simply isn't funny very often . it sometimes seems as though most of the film was transcribed from 10-year-old jerry seinfeld routines . it's hard to believe that after waiting over two years to follow up his $144 million film debut in the santa clause , tim allen decided this was the script he couldn't pass up . jungle 2 jungle doesn't give him nearly as much good material , relying on standard fish-out-of-water scenarios -- mimi siku dines on cat food and tropical fish , hunts pigeons and climbs on the outside of skyscrapers -- and a healthy serving of pratfalls . allen has many comic talents , including fine timing with an exasperated one-liner , but he is not particularly deft at physical comedy . when co-star martin short throws his tiny body at a locked door in a futile attempt to break it down , you see what a real physical comedian looks like ; allen just looks like he realizes he is much smarter than this material . everyone in jungle 2 jungle does thoroughly likeable work in their one-dimensional roles , which is probably as much as you should expect from the performances in a film of this kind . jungle 2 jungle is intended primarily for kids , of course , and it does offer some appealing bits . most of the best ones involve michael's ineptitude with mimi siku's sleep-inducing blow darts , including a very funny struggle to revive charlotte's anesthetized cat . the same kids who find that sequence hilarious probably won't be able to make heads or tails out of the big deal over some coffee , however , nor are they really a proper audience for swishy gay stereotypes or jokes about flatulence and penis size . there just didn't seem to be much thought put into jungle 2 jungle except to give it just enough tailoring to make it a tim allen vehicle . considering that the original outfit they were working with was a cinematic polyester suit like little indian , big city , it might have been a better idea to throw it all away and start from whole cloth .",0.4

"mad city is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed on the long track from premise to realization . the semi-serious film , which stars high-profile actors dustin hoffman and john travolta , and is directed by costa-gavras ( betrayed ) , becomes the latest in the recent flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in broadcast journalism . it's all ratings and entertainment value , not integrity ! unlike some of the more worthy contenders , mad city fails to bring anything new to the table . every aspect of this movie has been presented before in a better film with a more involving setup . if you've seen network , to die for , welcome to sarajevo , and especially billy wilder's 1951 biting satire , the big carnival ( aka ace in the hole ) , mad city will seem like a tired retread . the absence of originality and inspiration isn't mad city's only problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety . the film's goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type : the empty-headed local news personality , the arrogant network anchor , the innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune , and the old- fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated . even john travolta's sam baily isn't all that interesting -- he's basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him . mad city says everything it wants to say in its first forty-five minutes . after that , it spins its wheels for over an hour , waiting for the inevitable conclusion . despite costa-gavras' best manipulative efforts , sam never captures our sympathy . worse still , he's a static personality with no dramatic arc . he's the same at the end as at the beginning , and it's difficult for an audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth . travolta does an adequate job in this role , but he doesn't have a character of substance to work with . hoffman , who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic bernstein in all the president's men , is excellent as max , mad city's dubious moral compass . but , although hoffman gives max flair , there's little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script . none of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible exception of alan alda , who does a credible imitation of a snake in the grass . mad city's overall picture of the media is decidedly unflattering . the movie is also awash in subplots , none of which amount to much . in fact , they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two hour length . for a film that covers so much material , mad city seems surprisingly drawn out , but the reason is that it fails to do much of anything well . the satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective . watching mad city , i felt much the same way that i did 5 years ago while sitting through hoffman's hero -- great idea , poor execution . mad city doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never gels into a compelling story .

"it's an unfortunate thing to start off the 1997 movie season on such a low note . as disaster films go , turbulence is representative of the kind of mindless , lifeless nonsense that makes bloated thrillers like stallone's daylight seem brilliant by comparison . of course , with a bad movie of this sort , it's always possible to argue that it can be fun if approached in the right frame of mind . and , indeed , there are numerous instances when watching turbulence is more akin to viewing a parody like airplane ! than any of the numerous , supposedly-straight airport movies . often with bottom-of-the-barrel cinema , it's possible to make the case that a decent premise has been ruined by poor execution . not here . turbulence was a bad idea from the start , and the film makers continued to make mistakes all the way through -- from casting and scripting to editing and special effects . even the release was mishandled . this is clearly a christmas movie ( all the decorations and tunes offer a none- too-subtle hint of this ) , yet , because mgm feared it would get lost in the december blitz , they delayed its opening by several weeks . all things considered , i doubt the box office results will be significantly different . most of the action in turbulence takes place ( no surprises here ) on a plane . for a little while , the movie pretends that ryan is an enigma , and hints that he might not be guilty , but , since he's being played by veteran psycho ray liotta , we know it's only a matter of time before he snaps . turbulence exceeds any reasonable limit placed on suspension of disbelief . the film is littered with hard-to-swallow implausibilities . if landing a 747 is this easy , why is it hard to find trained pilots ? ( i know -- all serial killers in this genre are like cats with nine lives . ) on top of all that , even if you manage to swallow the plot , you still have to deal with some of the worst dialogue around today , much of which is delivered at the most inappropriate moments . any palpable tension drains away as these two babble incessantly in the empty cabin . there are more problems with turbulence , but i think i've made the point by now . considering how many solid leftovers from 1996 are still in theaters , i can't think of a reason why anyone would subject themselves to this offering . unless , that is , you're looking for cheesy special effects and a miscast lauren holly playing action heroine . at least it's not hard to understand why they called this turbulence -- it really is nauseating .",0.25

"sally potter's the tango lesson is a cold , antiseptic romance , a love story without a heart or soul . thanks to robby muller's striking black-and-white cinematography ( occasionally interrupted by spectacular bursts of color ) , the movie looks great , but , on an emotional level , it's as stiff and unyielding as a slab of granite . for a film that's supposed to be about one of the most passionate dances known to the world , the tango lesson comes across as flat and lifeless . watching this movie , i was reminded of a couple of other recent pictures that use pairs dancing ( as opposed to the flashdance variety ) as an integral aspect of the story . the first , strictly ballroom , is a glib parody of the romantic comedy/sports genre , and the second , shall we dance ? , isn't a conventional romance at all , but an examination of the path to personal freedom . and , while it's unfair to compare the intentions or plot of the tango lesson to those of either film , it's worth noting the differences in the way the dance numbers are presented . in both strictly ballroom and shall we dance ? , they are genuine celebrations of life -- energetic , vibrant , and engaging . in the tango lesson , they're nicely-choreographed , but cool and clinical . only one dance sequence ( a number near the end , featuring four participants ) works on a level other than the intellectual one . potter's story , although rather thin for a 100-minute motion picture , contains some clever elements . it's a fiction based on fact that uses real people , real locations , and real situations to spin off a narrative . the apparent result of this pact , a canny mix of fact and fiction , is the tango lesson -- a film about tango that features veron . one of potter's most egregious errors is casting herself as the lead . this is her acting debut , and it shows -- not only is she ineffective , but she has no screen presence whatsoever . i'm sure that taking the top role in the tango lesson appealed to her vanity , but it's a huge misstep . pablo veron , her co-star ( also making his feature debut ) is more lively but not more accomplished . the tango lesson is at its best not when the characters are dancing , but when it's exploring the creative process . the last half hour , as potter endures the difficulty of bringing her new film to life , is intriguing for the insight it offers into the difficulties of producing art , especially when it involves collaboration . sadly , there's not enough of that material to sustain the film , and sitting through the entire running length can , at times , be tedious . the tango lesson doesn't make you want to get up and dance ; it makes you want to go to sleep . - ingmar bergman",0.5

"second time director arne glimcher ( the mambo kings ) in 1995 decided to make a movie , just cause , that looks like a combination of silence of the lambs , dead man walking , and shaft . it is the least subtle movie i have seen in a long time . populated with cliched characters and fast paced , it does entertain , but it demands a high tolerance for unbelievability . there is that old suspension of disbelief problem . in the hannibal lecter role , harris give either a brilliant or an excessively ridiculous performance . you choose . one could make an argument either way . in another implausible role , we have kate capshaw as armstrong's wife laurie . capshaw is totally unconvincing , and this link between the two cases is a silly plot device . so what is good about this absurd show ? several things actually . sean connery is a fascinating and compelling actor . here he gives an excellent performance in a ridiculous movie . fishburne ( what's love got to do with it ) manages to take a bunch of stupid lines and somehow make them worth hearing . his screen presence is amazing . ultimately , i even liked harris as the uncontrollable psychopath . editor william anderson keeps the movie going at a lightning pace . the sounds of the swamp are menacing , and the gators are ready to chop off legs in a flash . eerie . although the script by peter stone and jeb stuart based on the novel by john katzenbach has all of the delicacy of a meat cleaver and seems incapable of surprise , the show takes a sharp turn in the middle that is a real jolt . on the whole the film ends up no more than an unbelievable action picture with a few rewarding performances . it is rated r . there is no sex or nudity , but there is violence , a few gory scenes , and some bad language . it would be okay for most teenagers . i can not bring myself to recommend just cause , but you might find it enjoyable albeit totally unbelievable . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.5
"but that's never stopped them before . a home of our own is supposed to be a deeply-moving emotional experience , showing how a fatherless family can face down any odds if they stick together . you know the kind of movie that i mean - one that has women reaching for tissues and men clearing their throats . supposedly based on a true story , it contains all the elements of bad melodrama , and the overall effect is overly-sentimental , bordering on cloying . there's even an ending that rivals that of scent of a woman for silliness . it seems unlikely that a factual story would follow so many well- established hollywood formulas , but that's what happens in a home of our own . there aren't too many that this movie misses , the most obvious and disappointing of which is the mother/son conflict that has become obligatory in any picture that touches , however briefly , on a coming-of- age . at best , the resolution of this subplot is weak . in a way , it's too bad that the movie always takes the easy way out because , taken individually , many of the scenes are effective . this is poignant and effective without resorting to the manipulation that is present throughout too much of the film . another thing i found annoying about a home of our own is the voice-over - a depressingly overused tool in these sorts of retrospective films . sometimes it works , but more often than not , as here , it gives the film makers an easy way out . they no longer have to show emotions and events , they can simply relate them through the narration . this technique leads to gaps in the story , and an general feeling on the part of the viewer that he's missing something important . the acting is a mixed bag . kathy bates is superlative as frances , and has found a female character with real depth and strength . these are rare enough in movies these days that when one shows up , no matter how dubious the film's quality is , an actress will jump at it . clarissa lassig opened my eyes as young lynn , managing a quality of fresh innocence that is enjoyable to watch . edward furlong has improved since american heart , but his range is still limited . perhaps the most obvious problem with a home of our own is that there's nothing new in it . pieces of this film can be found in recent offerings from this boy's life to a bronx tale . maybe the release timing is poor , but it seems like i've just gone through everything this movie has to offer in superior productions . a home of our own isn't a bad movie , but there's certainly no spark to make it stand out .",0.53
"their earnest , well-crafted stories of folks caught up in the turbulence of political violence have moved many viewers to heap adjectives of praise upon their films . and while all this occurs , i find myself sitting and thinking , "" you know , it was good , but . . . "" sheridan and george's latest collaboration , the boxer , falls into a very similar category . there are always plenty of things to like about a sheridan film , most notably his ability to create a vibrant sense of place . the divided belfast of the boxer is a startling image , with its physical wall dividing the people even more concretely than the differing ideologies . the insanity and self-perpetuating violence of the irish conflict are starkly portrayed , with more ambiguity surrounding the question of right and wrong than most films on the subject -- including sheridan and george's own previous films -- have managed to explore . for all its welcome complexity of theme , however , the boxer tends to drift in the exploration of its main characters . nowhere is this more evident than in the love story between danny and maggie , a star-crossed romance which feels more obligatory than well-developed . furtive glances and snatches of conversation establish tension between them , but their connection is never entirely convincing . in one sense , it's an effective device which turns him into an abstract rallying point for the ira rather than an individual human being . none of which is to suggest that the performances aren't strong from top to bottom , because they are . daniel day-lewis brings a resigned dignity to danny ; his unwillingness to return to the ira's ways seems as much a result of fatigue than moral scruple . their stories always hold your attention , but they never engross the way great film stories do . perhaps my sense in the boxer , and with in the name of the father and some mother's son for that matter , is that sheridan and george are more interested in making a point than making a movie . the result is a cerebral film with too little gut-level emotion . sheridan and george are good film-makers , but they could be great if they were as attentive to their people as to their politics . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.7
"but tony , one of the many characters to join the bizarre cross-country trek chronicled in flirting with disaster , is an arm-pit man , and that says something about writer/director david o . russell's flamboyant , irreverent sense of humor . in fact , although flirting with disaster is not as corrosive as russell's debut feature , spanking the monkey , it's just as wild , just as strange , and even funnier . david o . russell takes the traditional road picture and does some really strange things with it . with a view of middle america that david lynch would applaud , russell peels back the layers of normalcy to reveal the twisted and absurd things that go on underneath . however , where lynch makes his case through violence and mysticism , russell uses outrageous humor and parody . the results are no less telling , however . if it's not a false lead , it likely involves some time in handcuffs . but if there's one lesson he learns , it's that sometimes it's better to appreciate what you have instead of yearning for what you don't . to be sure , mel grows from his experience , but if he had it to do over again , he'd probably stay home . russell has paced his film perfectly , gradually building from the relatively normal to the extremely strange , and heightening the humor with each new twist . flirting with disaster has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek the entire way ; there's no opportunity for serious introspection . by the time the ninety-minute film has expired , you'll be glad you joined mel and company on this hilariously eccentric journey .",0.8
""" we're gonna be too big for hamburg . we're gonna be too big for liverpool . we're gonna be too big for our own bloody good . "" oliver stone probably loves this film . not only is backbeat a story from "" his "" era , the early sixties , but it bears more than a passing resemblance to one of his own pictures , the doors ( although it should be noted that backbeat moves a lot faster ) . if nothing else , however , stone usually gets his characters right , but the failure to create a compelling protagonist is this movie's greatest flaw . i would have enjoyed backbeat more if i had begun to feel something for any of the men or women populating this tale . however , since director iain softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vibrant personalities , he is unable to harness the full power of his story . in fact , the script itself is not tightly-focused , although the lack of a strong lead character could in part be responsible for this . while backbeat does , to some extent , fulfill both of these goals , it does neither to full advantage . when the film works , it's because the two purposes complement each other ; when it fails , it's because they are at odds . mr . softley uses an almost-documentary style of filmmaking , complete with unusual camera angles and often-dark settings , to bring home the immediacy of his motion picture . this is successful more often than not , but it could be argued that this method aids in further distancing the characters from the audience . music--rock 'n roll in particular--saturates backbeat . it has the most thunderous soundtrack since that of the commitments and , if marketed right , will sell tons of cds and tapes . nevertheless , all the visual and audio flare--and the tremendous energy that goes with them--can't quite make up for those elements where the film is found lacking . what makes it even more surprising that the characters have such little magnetism is that , for the most part , the actors portraying them do excellent jobs . other than having a somewhat variable accent , stephen dorff is fine as stu sutcliffe and , excepting a single over-the-top scene , twin peaks sheryl lee does a credible job playing astrid . ian hart gives an amazingly energetic and powerful rendering of john lennon . movies like backbeat are often the most difficult for me to review . i recognize the craft used in making the film , i admire the intent , and i like the music . the problem is , the characters don't grab me , and the story meanders a little too much to limit the importance of these minimalist personalities . many will doubtless feel differently , especially those with a special interest in the early days of the fab four . it's too bad this film didn't do as good a job capturing the other elements surrounding the group as they did those two aspects .",0.59

"watching the cell is akin to watching a demo reel for the film's art directors , makeup artists , production designer and costume designer -- which , i'm sure , it will end up being . make no mistake about it , the cell is the kind of film technical craftspeople lie awake fantasizing about . the result can be the eye-popping stuff of oscar nominations ( and wins ) , a film people walk away from thinking what all art directors , makeup artists , production designers and costume designers secretly want viewers to walk away thinking : "" boy , that looked incredible .

's "" losing my religion "" ) is clearly going for a silence of the lambs-meets-seven vibe , a commercially wise decision given the financial success of those films . there are heroes with their own demons to banish , interactions between killer and profiler , a screaming woman to be saved , some stark desert landscapes and some grisly images you'll just want to purge from your brain . the parts are right , but they're not put together in a way that adds up to anything . both deane and novak get 30-second character development moments to explain their motivations , including a provocative hint at novak's own dark childhood , while most of the film treats them like props to throw into stargher's messed-up head . considering the film takes nearly an hour to throw them there -- spending an inordinate amount of time on the police work that locates stargher , when that's not really the point of the story -- the fuzzy characterizations are eminently noticeable . singh's shots are often effectively disorienting , including one arcing shot that ends with the camera swinging upside down into water . many of the nightmare concepts ( a hideous bit of psycho-torture ) and directing tricks with which singh dresses up his film are utterly unique ; nearly as many are stuff out of intro to music video auteurs' freaky surrealist visuals . eventually , it becomes difficult to take the cell seriously , because so much of the imagery feels cribbed from 20 years of mtv . the 1984 dennis quaid fantasy dreamscape at least found some fun in walking through another person's psyche . the cell is supposed to be terrifying , but when a serial killer's mindscape resembles an s&m variation on a robert palmer video , his power to intimidate can't help but diminish . the juxtaposition of the two stories allows each protagonist the opportunity to get a big dramatic moment . unfortunately , they have nothing whatsoever to do with one another , which is yet another example of the cell's fundamentally flawed storytelling -- it takes far too long to get into its central concept , then tries to make up for that mistake by lingering there once it's already served its purpose . i didn't necessarily expect the cell to be a film that would stand up to much scrutiny . i did expect something that would provide the shock of the new . singh and his crew don't provide enough that's shockingly new to make up for the cell's lapses as a narrative . boy , the cell's visuals looked incredible . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"few people who have seen the classic 12 angry men from 1957 will ever be able to forget it . the film itself has a history of which only the most avid cinema buffs are aware . the secret is that the 1957 movie is a direct adaptation of a live television production from 1954 . the production won three major emmy awards -- best director for franklin schaffner , best actor for robert cummings , and most of all , best writer for reginald rose . rose's script would be used with minor changes but no substantial improvements in the 1957 movie as well as the 1997 television remake . i went to the museum of television and radio in manhattan to view the original 1954 production . besides the facilities for viewing just about any old television program imaginable , they have several different collections being shown simultaneously on movie sized screens . my favorites of the latter were an anthology of science fiction in television over the past forty years and one featuring three classic alfred hitchcock episodes . but i digress . the plot , which looks simple , becomes anything but as the story unfolds . although the cast is perhaps not quite as strong as in the remakes , it has significant depth . among others , the cast includes robert cummings , franchot tone , edward arnold , paul hartman , john beal , and walter abel . the show starts with a dramatic charge by an excessively somber judge . "" i urge you to deliberate earnestly and thoughtfully , "" he intones with the low bass voice of a old preacher at a funeral . "" you are faced with a grave responsibility . "" most of the jurors keep their ties on and their coats buttoned , as was the custom of the time , making the heat even more insufferable . "" i've never seen a guiltier man in my life . "" some are reasonable but others stick to diatribes . the intelligent script manages to include most types of people with the racist on the jury being the most outlandish . the great testament to the quality of the story is that none of the 12 feel like cliches although many certainly are . the story has a timelessness and an honesty to it that few others can match . robert cummings plays the persistent juror who wants to slow down the process at least enough so that the young kid charged with murder gets a fair hearing in the jury room . since it was live tv one can never be sure why , but he gets his words a bit mixed up at first and almost starts to stutter . it was probably planned , and it is just the kind of realistic event that would happen in such circumstances . cummings gives the best of several outstanding performances . the production is full of theatrics such as the men's almost coming to blows , but it is presented with such honesty that it is easy to forgive its shortcomings . as the people sweat and the street sounds from outside flow into the room , every member of the viewing audience feels like they are on the jury as well . despite what you might believe , early television was generally fairly awful . studio one : twelve angry men runs probably an hour or so without the commercials . it is not rated but would be pg only for the mature themes , and the show would be fine for kids old enough to be interested . i recommend it strongly if you should ever be presented an opportunity to see it , and i give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.8

"" it is only because these relationships with darlington and his father are so fully developed that the relationship between stevens and miss kenton can be convincingly poignant . it also doesn't hurt that anthony hopkins turns in the single best male performance of the year as stevens . it is not so much his ability to deliver a line which raises him above the pack , although he is brilliant there as well ; rather , it is his precise command of shrugs , turns of the head and almost imperceptible eye movements that is incomparable . it's wonderfully funny because stevens is trying so desperately to maintain his dignity in an inherently undignified situation . this is one of the finest physical performances in many years , beginning with one of the first moments he appears on screen , walking with stooped shoulders through an empty parlor . the technical end of the remains of the day is , as expected , glorious as well . director james ivory creates some marvelous shots , many framed through windows to lend a sense of voyeurism . the photography is sharp , capturing the vastness of darlington hall expertly , and a beautiful score by richard robbins lends the perfect air of gentility . the remains of the day is just as visually striking as howards end , and the performances are just as solid . what gives remains an edge over its much-lauded cousin is a more focused narrative which is riveting where howards end wandered . the world of stevens the butler is one well worth visiting for a thoroughly magnificent film experience .",1

"cartoons were originally just the opening act to whet the audience's appetite for the cinematic main course . walt disney changed all of that in 1937 with the first feature-length animated movie , snow white and the seven dwarfs . since then what brings people into the theaters , rather than the now ubiquitous video rental emporiums , has changed dramatically . the movies that make money these days rely heavily on star power or special effects , frequently both . young kids are seen less and less at the multiplex because studios are ignoring them . is it that fewer kids are coming and therefore the studio's wise marketeers are cutting back on kids' movies to match the decrease in demand ? yet some animated movies have been successful and a few , such as the lion king , have been incredibly lucrative . so what does it take to make a winning movie with cartoon characters ? although there is no sure and certain recipe , aside from having a disney logo , some of the ingredients include color , images , music , humor , and a compelling story . its popularity comes from a combination of all of the above ingredients , but one part stands head and shoulders above the rest -- the images , which are worthy of a master painter . this film is so beautiful that , if the sound system were to go out , you would have absolutely no reason to demand your money back . just watching the picture provides the vast majority of the enjoyment , which is not to say that the other parts have problems since they do not . although the songs are the film's weakest element , even some of them , especially "" dancing bear "" , are quite lovely . historians would be well advised to skip the picture for it plays fast and loose with the facts , but others will not care . this is a cartoon to entertain audiences , not an instructional video . ryan becomes the character rather than the other way around , unlike the genie in aladdin , for example , who became robin williams . if your girls are looking for a good role model , look no further . the twist is that anya may actually be anastasia . ( anastasia has a cute little dog named pooka , who , unlike most cartoon characters , does not get to talk . ) his hands fly off , his mouth falls down and he generally cannot keep himself together -- we've all had days like that . the memorable parts of anastasia are the visuals . although words cannot do them justice , let me mention a few of the best . oranges and reds dance across the screen as the heat of the flames makes the air undulate in front of the viewers . when the train crashes down into the canyon , it explodes in a fireball both realistic and gorgeous . the characters are all drawn with life-like delicacy . it is easy to go on , but the film is more to be seen than discussed . it is rated g and would be fine for the whole family . there is some potential that the littlest munchkins might be scared by rasputin , but i saw no evidence of it in our packed theater . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the show was "" pretty good "" and that he liked the funny doggie ( pooka ) the best . a surprised and wide-eyed dimitri remarks , "" that will work .

"the public loves it -- there are truman addicts who go to sleep with the tv on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't miss anything when they're taking a bath . every individual in "" the truman show "" is an actor with one important exception : the lead character himself . he thinks this is all real , and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal -- that there's nothing counterfeit about truman . for those who bemoan hollywood's consistent lack of originality ( as i frequently do ) , the truman show is a welcome surprise . over the years , there have been many satires about the power of television , but none has taken this route . the only thing i wonder is whether something this quirky will be able to find a large enough audience to justify the budget . paramount pictures is clearly using the truman show as an example of summer counterprogramming . the movie opens up a scant two weeks after godzilla and announces its intentions with the first line : "" we're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects ? "" but are we ? more importantly , is jim carrey's draw strong enough to pack theaters showing this movie , especially when his role here is light years away from the zany character he usually plays ? and how badly will marketing the truman show as a comedy hurt the movie when viewers realize that's not what it is ? these questions , which lie at the heart of the picture's hope for success , will be answered fairly quickly once it is released . for carrey detractors who are easily turned off by the comic's rubber-faced antics , the truman show proves to be an eye-opener . not only does carrey remain rigidly-controlled and reigned in , but it would be fair to call his performance both understated and effective . exhibiting the charm and charisma of a tom hanks or even a young jimmy stewart , carrey develops the sort of likable personae that a movie of this sort needs to succeed . most movies today run far too long , but the truman show is actually too short . a considerable amount of worthwhile material goes unexplored . i would have liked to know something about the personal pressures faced by the actors in "" the truman show "" and more about the incredibly complex logistics of controlling and filming the entire life of one man . narratively , the film is a little rough around the edges , as if a lot more was filmed than what shows up on-screen , but , although the flow may be off a little , it's not difficult to follow what's going on . stylistically , the truman show uses an interesting approach , intercutting documentary-like interviews and lengthy excerpts from the program ( these can be identified by the elliptical matte around the frame ) with "" real life "" footage of the director and behind-the-scenes people . weir isn't the first film maker to apply this technique ( it's a "" mockumentary "" staple ) , but he uses it to good effect , and it works well in the context of this movie . as an intriguing , well-written piece of entertainment and a mild social commentary , the truman show deserves high marks . not everything in the film works , and the script isn't perhaps as deep or incisive as it would like us to believe , but there's enough here to mark the truman show as a worthwhile motion picture -- an appealing , offbeat , one- hundred minute diversion for those who really are tired of monsters tearing down buildings and action heroes saving the world .

"with all apologies to it's a wonderful life and miracle on 34th street , charles dickens' a christmas carol is probably the best-loved , most often retold christmas story of them all . there's something in its message of spiritual rebirth and redemption that strikes a responsive chord in all of us , especially in an age when the focus of the holiday season has shifted more to material goods than altruism . most everyone , i'm sure , recognizes a little bit of scrooge in themselves . the best production of all was the 1951 black-and-white classic with alistair sim as the detestable skinflint . it can be debated at endless length whether it's a good idea to inject song-and-dance numbers into dickens' tale . purists probably don't like it , but if it can be done with victor hugo's les miserables , there's no reason why it can't succeed with a christmas carol . so , the problem with scrooge isn't the concept itself as much as the execution . even though bricusse was given an oscar nomination for the movie , the songs ( with one exception : "" thank you very much "" ) are instantly forgettable . unlike the great musicals , where you might find yourself humming a tune a few days later , with scrooge , you'll be lucky if you remember the name of one of the songs a few hours later . the screenplay is faithful to the original story . of all the scrooges to pass across the screen , none has been as convincing or memorable as alistair sim . albert finney , one of today's best character actors , places himself somewhere in the middle of the pack with this hammy , albeit enjoyable , portrayal . if there's a standout performance in scrooge , it belongs to alec guinness , who turns in an unconventionally energetic and sadistically high-spirited version of jacob marley's ghost . never before nor since has marley been played with such a bizarre mixture of the nasty and the good-natured . kenneth more is suitably jovial and larger-than-life as the boisterous ghost of christmas present . scrooge is basically a harmless , fitfully enjoyable version of the timeless classic , and worth a look for those who have had their fill of the more serious adaptations . it's entirely suitable for family viewing and , if the mood tends to become a little too sweet at times , keep in mind the season it was designed for .",0.65

"screenplay : kevin jarre . after a few decades when westerns were about as easy to find as jimmy hoffa , it seems like you can't sneeze at the movies these days without hitting a horse . tombstone is the name , ma'am , and surprisingly lively entertainment is the game . while no great piece of art , tombstone is a real old-fashioned shoot-em-up , energetically staged and acted and featuring a particularly memorable performance from val kilmer . but even that battle is not the end , as tombstone becomes the nexus of a blood feud which won't end until one side or the other is completely dead . it's action that tombstone is about first and foremost , and it delivers big time . there are few slow stretches , and they usually build towards something . the big shootout at the ok corral might be the least effective of the action pieces ; it's edited in a fairly confusing fashion which may accent the chaos of the situation but doesn't always make it clear who's shooting whom . otherwise the action is extremely well-choreographed , backed up by a bruce broughton score a bit too reminiscent of his work on silverado . fortunately , the action is where the comparisons to rambo end . tombstone is well-acted by its ensemble cast , in spite of the most distracting ( if authentic ) facial hair this side of gettysburg . kurt russell , never the most versatile of leading men , does bring an intense and reluctant heroism to wyatt . sam elliott and bill paxton are a bit more wooden in less-developed roles , but for the stoic and civic-minded earps it's not a distraction . sure , his lines are campy and anachronistic , but they are also quite funny . he drawls out his quips with a sly confidence , and turns in probably his best all-around performance yet . delaney is lovely , but her character is just a distraction ( as , unfortunately , are all of the female characters in tombstone ) , never adding anything in particular to the story or to wyatt's character . their scenes together seem simply to be a nod to the conventional wisdom that you need a love story to get women into the theater . while it's spending time wandering through the flowers , tombstone is nothing special , but when it sticks to its guns it generally finds its target .",0.7
"are our lives merely a collection of random walks that by middle age have culminated in varying degrees of success or failure ? do our socioeconomic backgrounds determine our destinies ? the mesmerizing film 42 up provides many illuminating and sometimes quite surprising answers to these and other such eternal questions . the series is the longest running documentary in the history of the cinema . and the best . so what is the prevailing mood in 42 up ? middle-age contentment . using the jesuit maxim , "" give me a child until he is 7 , and i will give you the man , "" the series posits that a child's future is already set by the age of 7 . the overwhelming conclusion one comes to on viewing the movie , which is structured with overlapping interviews of each person at differing ages , is how remarkably prescient we are as young children . if kids set their minds to accomplish something , even if it sounds foolish or capricious , it's likely to happen , albeit perhaps not with the degree of success imagined . another revelation is how we are all different and yet similar . even in a class society like britain , all of the participants , with one exception , worked their way to middle class or better . most have several kids , including those who earlier firmly and unequivocally renounced ever having kids . although their collective wisdom is fascinating , their individual stories are even more compelling . the interviews are generally conducted with the spouse , if any . with his thick cockney accent and his broad smiles , he's both the hardest to understand and the most likeable . a cherubic rapscallion who seems straight from central casting , he's made a little money on the side with minor acting jobs in television shows . a rebellious chain smoker at age 21 , suzy isn't the least bit interested in kids or anything else . never feeling like he belongs to either race , he's a quiet type with a simple philosophy -- "" i just want to be like anybody else , nothing too marvelous .

"viewing brother of sleep is the cinematic equivalent of watching a train wreck . it's definitely not a pleasant experience , but there's such a concentration of intense tragedy and drama that it's impossible to look away . brother of sleep is wrenching , depressing , and often unpleasant , and there are plenty of narrative flaws , but the overall experience lies within the scope of what one expects from a well-made motion picture . director joseph vilsmaier , who made the memorable epic stalingrad , has chosen to adapt robert schneider's novel in an artistic manner that borders on excessive . despite its stern stance against organized religion ( the hypocrisy of which gets skewered at every opportunity ) , the film endorses spirituality , and , as a result , there's a strange , almost- mystical quality to the tone . even though the music itself isn't that convincing , the raw passion is , making this one of those transcendent scenes that justifies a trip to theater for brother of sleep . while the romance works , it's not as involving as it could be . the distance between the audience and the characters keeps us from caring deeply about how things are resolved . there are times when we can feel the lonely gulf separating elsbeth and elias , but that's not always the case . unlike jude , which plunges us into the heart of a doomed love affair and keeps us there , brother of sleep's stylistic flourishes don't foster the kind of intimacy necessary to fashion an equally wrenching storyline . it always seems to be raining or snowing , and the ground is a like a sea of mud and slush . this isn't a film for those who want their movie characters to be neat and presentable . elsbeth is easily the most sympathetic person in the movie , even after she's largely out of the action . andre eisermann plays elias as slightly detached and distracted -- someone who lives on a different plane than everyone around him . there are times when brother of sleep's narrative is choppy , but this does little to blunt the impact of the key themes . and , although vilsmaier's surreal style may detract as much from the film as it adds , much of the most provocative material comes through unscathed , including the central metaphysical conflict between the demands of genius and the desires of the body . brother of sleep isn't the kind of movie to seek as a cure for depression , but , for those looking for a downbeat excursion into artistic storytelling , this film offers a solid example .",0.7

"commandments , the first major feature from writer/director daniel taplitz , is a satire of faith , religion , and hypocrisy . strangely enough , it's also the most offbeat disaster movie to come along in years ( note : that's "" disaster movie "" not "" movie disaster "" ) . commandments even borrows volcano's tag line -- "" the coast is toast "" -- during a key scene . and there's a dog that makes it through the movie alive ( although he loses a leg ) . taplitz obviously intended this to be a black comedy , and , viewed as such , it's reasonably successful . a few of the theological questions posed here are ones that fundamentalists tend to sidestep or talk around because they raise disturbing possibilities . and some of the satire is as vicious as it is risky , which may alienate mainstream viewers . "" get back to me when you start breaking some really serious ones , "" he says . give taplitz credit for casting a pair of good-looking actors as the leads . aidan quinn and courtney cox are appealing and attractive , and they work well together . commandments occasionally strays a little too far into the romance arena , but i suppose that's designed as a tonic for the cynical perspective embraced by large chunks of the film . as much as i appreciate commandments' mocking approach to certain aspects of religion , the movie's theology is confused and contradictory . in addition to satirizing belief systems , i think taplitz is trying to say something positive about faith and god , although i'm not sure what . that , no matter how many commandments you break , if you turn back to the lord , you will be saved ? perhaps . maybe . unlikely , but not impossible . commandments isn't at all clear about its real feelings about religion , and this creates some serious questions about what the movie's central message is . nevertheless , although the mixed signals detract from commandments' basic entertainment value , they don't doom the film . it's still enjoyable in a strange , unorthodox sort of way , and it looks great . ( cinematographer slavomir idziak , kieslowski's longtime collaborator , also worked on decalogue , perhaps the most thought-provoking cinematic exploration of the ten commandments . ) while the script isn't a masterpiece of twists and surprises , not everything goes as expected , and the audience isn't quite as far ahead of the characters as it initially thinks . for anyone who isn't easily offended and doesn't mind forthright irreverence , commandments is worth checking out -- at least you haven't already seen five movies like it already this year .",0.7

"" well , this is based on an old tv series , but it is as far from a true story as can be . the notes were from another movie i had seen recently . here the people are pure plastic and the show is either hilarious camp or tedious failed attempts at comedy . there was one person in my audience that got it , but the rest of us stared at the screen waiting for the next little good line to come along . the saving grace of the picture is that the dialog by the writing committee of jim berg , harry elfont , deborah kaplan , and stan zimmerman does have some nice one liners every now and then . i never saw the brady bunch movie , which my fellow critics tell me was better - i would hope so , or even the television series so perhaps i am not qualified to review this film , but i will anyway . my theory is that if you pay your seven dollars at the box office and drop another seven at the concession stand , you should be to enjoy a film without having to have already seen anything else . actually , i am not sure having seen the original or the television series would have made this lame attempt at film making any more palatable . there are some problems like her ex-husband doesn't sound or look like he used to . sure . well , it actually sounds funny when he says it . soon the cast is off to hawaii which provides lots of nice visuals . there actually is not much of a plot . the show and the scenery are only pretexts for showing off all of the brady's 1970 style outlandish bad taste in clothes and to make fun of their syrupy sweet life style . parts of the little subplots work and others don't . most of these put-downs are off-the-wall enough to be funny . perhaps in another film this would have not been so objectionable , but in this lighthearted little piece of family drama , it just does not belong . some of the dialog is worth a chuckle or two . definitely a different dogma . in a funny take off on the bad language of most movies today , the impostor tells carol's real husband , "" i'm going to kick your brady butt .

"in my review of john sayles' 1996 film lone star , i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something . such was my confidence in sayles' storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough . in that particular case , i was right . sayles' new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration , and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant . and it just wasn't there . for the first hour , there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel . here , alaska has at least two faces : the raw , blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings , and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness . sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters , but it's the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight . for half the film , limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers , even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there . i suppose you could see the second half as sayles' attempt to show just how far civilization has to go , if you were feeling particularly generous . even worse , the links to the first half's portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best . the second half is solid enough , but it's a jarring shift . instead of a novel , sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit . john sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking , with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail . sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film , turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing ( another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler ) . he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera . in limbo , all those fascinating things just don't add up to a fascinating , unified story . limbo isn't a disappointment because he doesn't say enough , as in the ambiguous final shot . it's a disappointment because he tries to say too much . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6

"" nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain . schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . there is no such figure in amistad . the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . - ingmar bergman",0.8
"mpaa rating : not rated ( graphic depictions of corpses , profanity ) running time : 150 minutes . such are the vagaries of critical opinion , that temporal beast , that i found my experience of joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases . as a carefully constructed detective story , paradise lost is riveting ; as a study of small town america at its best and its worst , it is compelling . however , as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal justice system , it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary . damien , an occult-fascinated , heavy metal-listening eccentric , is particularly tailor-made for prosecution , but there are potential problems with the case . there also happens to be virtually no physical evidence , and plenty to suggest that the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the bodies were found . the first half hour of paradise lost introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters , and to a setting which is as critical to the case as any piece of evidence . hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel is the film's most enigmatic figure , damien echols -- a perceptive , self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a satanist from central casting . the courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar from both fictional and real-life proceedings , but the knowledge of its reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling . then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land mines . it is a case of such complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy verdicts should be forced to watch paradise lost as a civics lesson . the courtroom drama of paradise lost is certainly intriguing , but i think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom , because the actual evidence is only half the story . outrage against the concept of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age , and paradise lost simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it . that is not to diminish its power -- paradise lost will have you asking yourself questions long after it ends . perhaps by the time i reach my own personal verdict , its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely .",0.8

"bruce willis , one of our most uneven actors , gives a terrific performance this time as that shadowy figure known as the jackal . at first even the fbi is not sure whether the jackal is a real person or just a myth . with a new identity and look every five minutes in the picture , it is no wonder that the jackal has remained so elusive . although the new movie the jackal by rob roy's director michael caton-jones acknowledges kenneth roth's screenplay for the day of the jackal in the credits , it shares little of the story . as the sincere ex-ira hit man named declan mulqueen , richard gere manages to keep his irish accent consistent and believable . although gere slightly underplays an already underwritten role , he gives a quite credible performance . the problems with the movie almost undermine it on several occasions . the script heaps several unnecessary leaps of faith on the audience , most surrounding the lack of seriousness american law enforcement officers place on the threat of a major assassination . more than once , when a place should be crawling with cops , mulqueen has to go mano a mano with the jackal . and the well executed ending is flawed by an illogical rabbit pulled out of a hat . the director does not get the show's motor in gear for over half an hour . after he does , he lets it slip into neutral too often in the non-action scenes . in most thrillers , consider the television "" prime suspect "" dramas , for example , the police's planning scenes are full of tension and energy . in the jackal , by contrast , there is a certain ennui to the proceedings . all of this notwithstanding , whenever willis is on the screen , the movie hums . the writing is smart in the way the jackal creates his disguises and switches back and forth seamlessly . even though the assassination attempt is telegraphed from early on , its execution will undoubtedly send chills up your spine . at the jackal's best , as it is in the last half hour , the movie has you on the edge of your seat . the problem with the film is that too often you may find yourself slumped back in your chair during the frequent slow interludes . it is rated r for some profanity and a few gory scenes . it would be fine for teenagers .",0.7
""" it's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time , history will record the greatness of [michael] collins and it will be recorded at my expense . "" not unexpectedly , writer/director neil jordan has been obligated to affirm the picture's integrity , stating at the toronto film festival that "" most of the people who accuse me of inflaming the peace process have no interest in the peace process whatsoever . "" in truth , while michael collins does distort elements of history , most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective . certain characters are combined , a few deaths happen differently from what history records , and events have been streamlined . the usage of such "" dramatic license "" is not uncommon in the development of reality- based movies , so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it exists in this case . perhaps the most suspect element of michael collins' script is the negative portrayal of irish hero eamon de valera . partisans of the late president will not react favorably to such speculation , even though , in the context of this narrative , it works . putting aside all the controversy , however , viewers are left with an expertly-directed and well-acted historical epic that disappoints only in its shallow perspective of the irish/british and irish/irish conflicts . this is a case where the era not only defines the character , but the character defines the era . it's impossible to tell the tale of michael collins without delving into the beginnings of the ira and the dramatic upsurge in support for sinn fein , yet there's a sense that important issues have been glossed over . however , jordan's view of characters and circumstances is remarkably even-handed -- he shows both the brutality and sensitivity of collins' nature , turning the man into the central figure of an almost-shakespearean tragedy . strong acting is a key reason why michael collins is as effective as it is . his portrayal of collins is the most passionate , powerful work he has ever done , easily eclipsing his oscar-nominated presentation of oscar schindler . for well over a decade , neeson has been carefully honing his talents , and the results are apparent here . although neeson's forceful performance drives the movie , he is assisted by an able supporting cast . alan rickman , best known for playing flamboyant villains ( die hard and kevin costner's robin hood ) gives a surprisingly low-key and introspective interpretation of de valera . and , despite a variable irish accent , julia roberts is more than capable in the small role of kitty kiernan , the woman who brings collins' human side to the fore . even for those who know the whole story of michael collins , the movie is still a riveting piece of film making , capable of holding an audience's attention for more than two hours . jordan not only does an exceptional job recreating the ireland of the 1920s , but presents us with an entirely human protagonist who's flawed yet sympathetic . collins is not the brash hero of the traditional historical epic -- he's a tormented individual who knows that his chief talent is for creating mayhem , but who wants peace so desperately that he's willing to die for it . leeson's portrayal of collins' agony during the civil war is so real that , at times , it's almost painful to watch . in tone and spirit , if not in time and place , this film shares a great deal with last year's oscar-winning braveheart . neil jordan felt that this story was so important that he nurtured the script for thirteen years until he had the clout to command the actors and budget he wanted . the ultimate result may not quite match his ambitions , but it will still be one of 1996's most talked- about motion pictures . -- ingmar bergman",0.8
"the third , i'll do anything , was transformed into a songless dramatic comedy following disastrous test screenings . since then , no one has attempted a non-animated , big screen musical ( evita is coming , but i'll reserve judgment until i see madonna in the title role ) . so , for those of us who appreciate the genre , the best place to look is the past . in filming the umbrellas of cherbourg , director jacques demy opted to sacrifice print longevity for vibrant color . by the mid-seventies , the only remaining copies of the film were in terrible condition . but demy , anticipating this problem from the outset , had archived multiple monochromatic negatives that , when properly combined with each other , allowed re-creation of the original color . first , unlike most big american productions of the time , there are no show-stopping production numbers . there's no dancing , no chorus , and no duets . secondly , there are no spoken lines of dialogue -- everything , from the mundane to the important , is sung . finally , the umbrellas of cherbourg isn't a lightweight bon-bon with a happily-ever- after ending . while the film has its share of effervescent moments , there's also an element of undeniable poignancy . watching the umbrellas of cherbourg , it's not hard to understand why deneuve became such an icon . she's the perfect lead for this film , which demands an actress possessing legitimate range . demy has used the musical to explore several universal themes , particularly the meaning and nature of different kinds of love . although most movies favor passion and true love , the umbrellas shows that another less demanding , more subtle kind of love has its own appeal . agnes varda's reconstruction has done the film justice . the colors , which include bright pinks , reds , purples , and oranges , look great , and the cleaned-up soundtrack is better than ever . although , as i said before , the umbrellas of cherbourg lacks song-and-dance numbers , there is one tune that recurs throughout . this song , beautifully composed by michel legrand , radiates longing and loss , and forms the movie's core . it , like the film , is far more powerful than one would initially suppose .",0.8
"escape from new york has one of the most ingenious premises of any film released during the 1980s . for this , if nothing else , director john carpenter ( halloween , starman ) deserves some credit . unfortunately , too much of the film's promise goes unfulfilled . escape from new york isn't really science fiction -- it's an action flick set in a futuristic setting . epic potential for a masterful , gripping tale is abandoned in favor of cheap thrills . action films have certainly come along way in the last fifteen years . in comparison to a die hard , escape from new york has such a low level of excitement that it could almost be considered plodding . carpenter peppers the film with bursts of action , but there are long , sometimes sluggish , pauses in between . also , surprisingly ( since carpenter is known as a "" master of suspense "" ) , escape from new york rarely generates much tension , and , when it does , it fails to sustain it . even the big finale , which involves a chase across a mined bridge , doesn't really get the adrenaline pumping . from an action/adventure standpoint , describing this film as anything better than adequate would be an unwarranted kindness . apologists for escape ( and there are mass legions of devoted fans ) point out that the film is as much a comedy as it is an action film . and , while it's certainly true that carpenter has infused the film with elements of irony and wit , his sense of humor is so dour that it rarely sparks more than fitful laughter . in fact , it's easier to recognize that escape from new york is trying to be funny than it is to actually unearth those few moments of comedy that appear more inspired than pointless . one area that doesn't merit criticism is the film's look . although shot on a modest budget of $7 million , escape from new york has the appearance of a more expensive picture . the skyline scenes of 1997 new york are very impressive . matte artists , set designers , model makers , and animators all deserve credit for creating a believably futuristic , decadent cityscape . cinematographer dean cundey gets a lot of nice , atmospheric shots that go a long way towards atoning for the film's faults . kurt russell is delightful as snake . the actor , known at the time for his disney films , makes a better-than-average action hero , incorporating aspects of clint eastwood's spaghetti western personality into his character . donald pleasence , adrienne barbeau , and harry dean stanton turn in solid supporting performances . stealing perhaps every scene he's in , however , is frank doubleday , whose turn as a bit player is so exaggerated and over-the-top that it's impossible not to notice him . so , considering all aspects of the production , what is escape from new york ? a failed science fiction spectacle that devolves into a mediocre action/comedy ? or an underrated cult classic that functions as a ground-breaking adventure film ? perhaps , as is so often the case , the truth lies somewhere in between . escape from new york is definitely watchable , and , at times , quite enjoyable . however , when the final credits roll , you can be forgiven a vague sense of dissatisfaction , because the creativity that went into formulating the premise was never extended to the script writing stage .",0.6
"pollock , about the renowned and controversial modern artist jackson pollock , is at once intriguing and insightful as well as boring and baffling . ed harris , who stars as pollock , makes his directorial debut with the film . although clearly a labor of love on harris's part , the film amply demonstrates why most actors need someone other than themselves giving them guidance . harris delivers one of his best performances , indeed , another oscar worthy one , but his director spoils what could have been a masterpiece by letting scenes drag on and on . still , for anyone interested in the creative process , the movie can be quite rewarding . it is difficult to show exactly how an artist goes from a blank canvas to a fully realized vision . pollock tries by simply letting us observe pollock at work . with the intense performance by harris as a troubled artist , the creative tension is almost palpable . acting like a manic-depressive , harris portrays pollock as a troubled soul . that he was able to create anything memorable through that alcoholic haze is quite surprising . one well-staged drinking-and-driving episode best illustrates the depth of pollock's troubles . although his work was frequently criticized as consisting of little more than random splashes , pollock defends his technique . basically a one-man show , it does have many other characters in complementary roles . towards the end of the picture , jennifer connelly , who was so spectacular recently in requiem for a dream , plays another of her more typical throwaway roles as the beautiful but vapid ruth klingman , the last of pollock's mistresses . is pollock a beautiful failure or a flawed success ? like his paintings , it is in the eye of the beholder . for me , it was better than a documentary on the history channel and well worth seeing . in an unsympathetic and enigmatic performance , harris creates a fascinating , flawed man of flesh and blood , who throws temper tantrums like a toddler one minute and acts like a recluse the next . if you can stay awake through the long dull periods , you will learn a lot and get to witness one of the best performances of the year in the process . it is rated r for language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers .",0.7
"planes , trains , and automobiles , a 1987 feature from john hughes , represented something of a watershed in the career of the prolific writer/director/producer . unlike most film makers working in that arena , hughes eschewed the cheap t&a exploitation of flicks like porky's in favor of surprisingly sensitive character interaction and relationship building . my recollection of seeing planes , trains , and automobiles during its theatrical run was that i laughed hard and often . re-watching it recently , however , i was struck that , while the comedy is undeniable , the dramatic underpinning of the script is stronger than i remembered . the "" hook "" that draws the viewer in is the humor , but the movie's real appeal is the characters . don't mistake what i'm saying -- there's nothing deep , dark , or profound lurking in the subtext . this isn't dostoevsky , nor does it want to be . but it takes the time to round out the protagonists and allow us to care about what happens to them . there are moments in this film that tug at the heartstrings . this is like martin scorsese's after hours on a grander , less psychotic scale . but bad weather intervenes . what makes the trip even longer is that neal is stuck next to one of those good-natured , annoying talkers who won't shut up . we know they're eventually going to reach the windy city , so the fun is watching their slow , reluctant bonding as they take planes , trains , automobiles , and tractor trailers to get there . but , although he has a few memorable "" wild and crazy guy "" outbursts , martin's performance is largely restrained . he does a good job presenting the increasingly-desperate facade of a normal guy who is enduring a living nightmare , and who really doesn't want to have anything to do with the jovial boob who is drawn to him like a fly to garbage . martin enables us to empathize with neal by conveying the important fact that he isn't a nasty person -- he's just someone who's reacting badly to his circumstances . candy imbues del with more depth that one initially expects from the big man . one of the keys to planes , trains , and automobiles' success is that both actors develop their characters into fully-formed individuals instead of caricatures . planes , trains , and automobiles is one of those rare movies that manages to mingle outrageous comedy and light drama in such a way that we aren't repulsed or offended by its simplicity and occasional mawkishness . it's a fine cinematic treat that doesn't demand much from a viewer , but gives back a lot , both in terms of laughter and good feeling .

"as the old adage goes , be careful what you wish for lest you get it and , by implication , loathe it . starring macaulay culkin in his first big role , the movie was a hit for its slapstick humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups .

"this film , based on carl sagan's novel , is a mixture of sci-fi , romance , sentimentality , and drama , brought to screen by the director of forreset gump . it relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its powerful but soppy story , rather than its special effects , contrary to many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles . governments seem to trust this type and like to put them in charge of things . attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical differences , and nothing can get in the way of ellie's belief in evolution , not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of a religious zealot , one of those religious johnny-come-lately types . here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim-- that there is life in outer space . for these scenes , the film should have used the dictum from occam's razor : the simplest way to do something is the best way . as a sci-fi'er , with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy , this film is up to par with those star wars films , but is outclassed by 2001 . sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion , but i don't think he would have been to happy with the elementary-school theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials . i think the best answer a scientist could give in this scenario , was not given by jodi . . . but , a steven hawkings might have said that it is through these scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of god . it is a thing of great beauty . at least , this is what my science friends tell me is the more typical attitude toward god in their community .",0.5

"screenplay : peter hedges . director : lasse hallstrom . tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary . "" what's eating gilbert grape ? is such a film . it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . the same can be said of the character of gilbert . it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . "" johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .",0.9
"david lynch's nightmare debut film is shot in wonderful b&w ( in the expressionist mode of a german horror film ) . it features a unique soundtrack that is mostly made up of constant shrill sounds that might destroy your inner peace ( clangs , hissings , whistles , street noise , etc . ) , but it also has a lovely little song tract , sung by the deformed lady in the radiator ( laurel near ) , with the catchy lyric , "" everything is fine in heaven , "" as it is meant to offer hope to the despondent hero of this dream , who is probably thinking about suicide as an answer to his problems . the film is a long dream-sequence about an awful urban smoke-infested industrial city and other terrible things . this weird tale is an original , personal , and provoking work , capturing the darker side of modern urban life for the have-nots and the dark side of the dreamworld for the dreamer . the story makes little sense in the real world of things , but has its own logic within the contexts of the film . at least , certain experiences drawn from its little episodes can be related to one's own experiences , as it makes a striking impact on one's fragile modern psyche . this is what a cult film is supposed to be like , and in that sense , there is a certain ready-made audience for this film , who should be accepting of it even if they don't know what the film means in total . and , that's not so bad a thing in the case of this movie . those who like their films with a solid narrative , will not find what they are looking for here . he has a distinct nerdlike look , featuring a bride of frankenstein hairstyle and in his lapel there is a plastic-holder for his pencils and pens . the conversation is so slow in coming forth , that it is painful to listen to . inward tension , results in a dream within a dream , which shows henry's head being lopped off and made into a pencil-eraser , whereby the film gets its title from . he is seen appearing in a rock , slightly above henry's facial features . this is a film not made for strictly entertainment value , and to get the viewer involved in thinking about what all these symbols mean , requires some imagination on their part to interpret the dream . i would hazard a guess and say that the worm has something to do with the deformed baby and the concept of original sin . what it all means , is probably anyone's guess . but it is visual and shocking to the intellect . it is one of the more imaginative efforts put forth in an american film , reminding me most of a bunuel film . that as illogical , tedious , and repulsive as it may be , there is still something there that grabs our attention before we can turn away from it . somehow i get the feeling there are lots of people who can identify with henry , even if they will not admit to being nerds . i just loved the idea of the film , admittedly more than i loved watching the film ( i saw it on video , where the images were sometimes too dark ) . yet i found this imaginative work to be one of the more interesting films to come out of the '70s .",0.7
"for moviegoers who think that the problem with today's cinema is its reliance on subtlety and its lack of gore , luc besson ( the fifth element ) has made just the movie for them , the messenger : the story of joan of arc , a movie so over the top that it could become a campy cult classic . in 8mm , joel schumacher was criticized for making a sleazy movie about a search for a snuff film . ( poor dental health is so conspicuously featured in the movie that you half expect a toothpaste product placement . ) to dramatically underscore the point that the english soldiers are like animals , we witness them before the rape pouring stew on the top of the dirty table so they can then eat off of it like dogs . like a bad horror movie , besson has the interior lit by huge flashes of lightning . her performance , which at first seems quite impressive , quickly becomes tediously repetitive . most of the movie consists of confusing battle scenes of hand-to-hand combat . frantically edited to match joan's spastic energy , the scenes are so full of gore that the mpaa should now retire the nc-17 rating . if they can give this movie an r , which they did , then there is no point any longer in pretending that the nc-17 rating even exists . besson shares the writing credits , if not exactly the honors , with andrew birkin , the author of such gems as king david . among the laughably bad lines is one uttered by the conscience ( dustin hoffman no less ) . for the messenger's audience , it is as soon as the ending credits begin to roll . the messenger : the story of joan of arc runs one hundred and forty one long minutes , but who's counting ? it is incorrectly rated r for strong graphic battles , a rape and language . it should be considered nc-17 and would be inappropriate for anyone less than a high school senior . sadly , there was an 8-year-old next to me and other kids even younger in our audience .",0.4
"although based on a real life hero , carl brashear , the first african-american navy diver , the movie features a tedious script by first-time film writer scott marshall smith that is so treacly that it could attract flies . and just in case you miss the precise moments in which you are expected to cry or applaud , mark isham's syrupy and bombastic music will remind you as it blasts through the theater's speakers . on the other hand , if you close your eyes and ignore the movie itself , it is easy to be impressed by the nobility and drive of the man himself . too bad that this movie doesn't serve him better . in an unbelievable and way over-the-top performance , robert de niro plays master chief billy "" i am god !

"my life's in turnaround is a case of art imitating life imitating art imitating life - or something like that . this movie chronicles its own genesis and making in a fictional-that's-almost-documentary-like fashion . weird ? to say the least . funny and insightful ? without a doubt . that depends on what you enjoy in a movie . for me , it is . the story behind my life's in turnaround is fascinating , and that's one of the reasons why the film is so entertaining . the problem was that they didn't have a script - or even the idea for a script ( "" i think this whole idea thing is overrated "" ) - nor did they know the first thing about production , direction , or camerawork . but through determination borne of ignorance and stubbornness , and aided with unbelievably good luck , this movie was made . the price tag was $22 thousand , with the photography done on 16 mm film . half the involved people were convinced , even after the production wasunderway , that the project would not be finished . i laughed a lot more during this film than during any of this year's so-called comedies out of hollywood . sure , most of those pictures have a few laughs to offer , but none match the level of constant hilarity attained by my life's in turnaround . from wit to zaniness , the movie spans the comic spectrum , with few - if any - of its jokes falling flat . quite an achievement for a pair of first-timers . the dramatic side of the story , which admittedly is neither deep nor profound , presents an interesting character study . their own words probably best describe them : "" we're not going to meet anyone . we're just going to die weird and dumb .

"screenplay : shane black . director : renny harlin . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . it is easy for me to understand the reasoning which pegged shane black's script for the long kiss goodnight as worth $4 million , because it includes all the elements which tend to make studio executives soil themselves in anticipation . a high concept premise , plenty of gratuitous violence , a little t&a , buddies exchanging profane one-liners , really big explosions . . . these are the stuff of blockbusters , my friends . they are also the stuff of inane , incoherent garbage , unlikely to gain any style points with inane , incoherent garbagemeister renny harlin ( cutthroat island ) at the helm . the thing is that the long kiss goodnight is a difficult film to dismiss , because it is just as often entertaining as it is actively infuriating . as inane , incoherent garbage goes , it's really not that bad . apparently that was not enough to shake his conviction that davis had the right stuff , and the long kiss goodnight sort of proves him right . there is something strangely satisfying about watching davis turn into a killing machine , while partner jackson ( as the down-on-his-luck gumshoe who usually does the ass-kicking in such films ) generally looks on ineffectually . it's primitive role-reversal stuff , but it works ; it's a great bit of business when hausfrau samantha takes a pie she has just baked in a pyrex dish and uses it to beat in the head of an assailant . jackson also gets a handful of simplistic but very funny gag lines , and even a line in which he makes fun of making up gag lines . it would be over-estimating the subtlety of the long kiss goodnight to refer to it as a satire , but its bending of conventions often works quite well . at other times , it is about as conventional as action film-making gets , and distressingly brutal . there is a sequence early in the film involving a deer hit by a car which will raise plenty of hackles , and it provides an appropriate prelude to numerous scenes of torture , disturbing fantasy/dream sequences and plenty of good old-fashioned shootings and stabbings . harlin and black also play unfair with the tired device of a child in distress , and manage to play plenty of bodily functions for gags along the way . into the middle of this rather crude mess they then drop half-hearted attempts at character development , with davis' discovery resulting in a split personality and jackson trying to redeem himself for something or other . yet i can't deny that the long kiss goodnight made me laugh , and that there was never a time when i was bored . yes , villains appear and disappear with scarcely a thought to explaining who they are or why they matter . yes , it is overloaded and overblown in a way which can make anyone who cares about good movies cringe . yes , it is sometimes becomes so violent as to be off-putting . the long kiss goodnight is an exploitation film , but it is an exploitation film with a sense of its own absurdity . you may not care at all about mitch henessey as a person , but you will probably find yourself enjoying his exasperated delivery of black's crude humor ; you may not really believe charley baltimore _is_ a person , but you might still find her exploits a guilty pleasure . the long kiss goodnight is an easy film to like , and equally easy to hate . what else can you say when you walk away from an inane , incoherent piece of garbage with a smile on your face ?",0.6
"for those who feel that movies should be more like tv , superstar , the latest movie by director bruce mcculloch ( his last was the abysmal dog park ) , is a movie-length version of a "" saturday night live "" skit . what this means exactly remains somewhat of mystery , but it has a sexual connotation . the sexually charged film pushes the envelope of its pg-13 rating as in such scenes as the one in which mary pushes up her breasts and has them talk to each other . it also skirts the rating by showing lots and lots of panties and some bras , but no actual nudity . relying on slapstick for most of its humor , a typical scene occurs in a confessional .

"sexual taboos come in all shapes and forms -- bestiality , pedophilia , incest -- but none creates a more vivid image than that of necrophilia . so , when i say that kissed is the character study of a necrophiliac , recognize that this film is intended for a very select audience . anyone who feels incapable of watching a movie that deals frankly with this subject ( even though it is , relatively speaking , tastefully approached ) should steer clear of kissed . director lynne stopkewich's feature is for adventurous movie-goers only . of course , this isn't the first motion picture to broach this "" forbidden "" subject , but it approaches the material in a far more serious and compassionate fashion than anything i can remember . and , as fundamentally unappealing as the concept of having sex with a corpse may be , kissed manages the considerably difficult task of humanizing a character involved in this practice . as a result , kissed isn't nearly as difficult or disturbing a film as one might suppose from a plot description . the central figure in this movie is sandra larson ( molly parker ) , a young woman who , by her own admission , has "" always been fascinated by death -- the smell of it , the feel of it , and the stillness of it . "" sandra isn't like other girls , though . she takes classes in embalming , even though she believes that cadavers can still feel what's being done to them . playing a role in a movie of this nature is a risky proposition for an actor , so , for that reason alone , one has to admire the courage of both molly parker and peter outerbridge . it helps , of course , that both present entirely believable performances and that they develop an effective rapport . parker , who bears a passing resemblance to american actress moira kelly , gives a slightly deeper reading than her co-star . the hallmark of kissed is its daring . at its heart , however , this movie isn't really trying to shock or revolt its audiences . it's telling a tender love story that just happens to include some exceptionally unconventional and controversial elements . what stopkewich does best here is to consistently avoid making the necrophilia gratuitous or exploitative . where he doesn't fully succeed is in conveying the spiritual rapture of sandra's secret experiences -- the use of white light , for example , comes across as corny and unconvincing . sandra may have been transported to another plane , but the director didn't get me to share the trip . a great deal more could be written about this film , since , even at only eighty minutes in length , it never fails to challenge viewers . for those who have trouble getting into , or dealing with , the primary subject matter , there are some interesting side issues . i certainly learned a great deal about what goes on behind the scenes at a funeral parlor . nevertheless , for anyone capable of keeping an open mind , kissed offers an unflinching perspective of a sweet , troubled love affair and the two warped individuals trapped in it .",0.7
"director : steven soderbergh . no previous adaptation of an elmore leonard novel -- and there have been a couple of pretty good ones recently in get shorty and jackie brown -- has captured the author's unique flavor as effectively as out of sight . though leonard usually writes about criminal characters , he doesn't exactly write crime novels ; though his stories are often quite funny , he doesn't exactly write comic novels ; though his narratives always come together in a way that makes sense , he doesn't exactly let tight plotting get in the way of an amusing tangent . leonard is his own literary animal : sometimes sordid , sometimes smirking , always sly . you'll find every one of those contradictions and then some in out of sight , a marvelously meandering caper with rhythms all its own . surprisingly , the ride proves intriguing to both parties . out of sight certainly works best as a quirky comedy , with screenwriter scott frank ( who also adapted get shorty ) providing great material for a superb supporting cast . steve zahn steals every one of his scenes as jack and buddy's perpetually stoned accomplice glenn , channeling crispin glover with considerably more appealing goofiness . there are even a couple of sharp unbilled cameos , including michael keaton reprising his jackie brown character and a final-scene appearance by another veteran of a previous leonard adaptation . good scripts make even mediocre actors look better ; frank's script in the hands of these actors is a hilarious gem . but out of sight isn't just a comedy . it's also a love story , if a very odd one . clooney has never looked more comfortable or charismatic on the big screen , nor has lopez , for that matter . with a clever nod to the fast-attraction nature of film romances ( in a reference to the redford-dunaway thriller three days of the condor ) , out of sight gets maximum mileage out of the pairing of its stars in a believable fast-attraction film romance . there are also plenty of crime caper elements mixed in with the comedy and romance , including no small amount of bloodshed , but even then the film seems entirely cohesive . credit director steven soderbergh with crafting a distinctive , unifying look and feel from frank's deftly back-tracking script . most frequently he employs an abrupt freeze-framing device , usually to mark transitions between scenes and locations . in soderbergh's capable hands the freeze-frames never feel gimmicky , instead playing as chapter stops on leonard's snappy punch lines . there's nothing particularly deep or intensely memorable about out of sight -- indeed , the pace flags a bit at times as it tries to keep up with all its characters -- but it's the kind of film that punches holes in the notion that "" entertaining "" and "" smart "" are mutually exclusive adjectives for a summer film . this is pure pulp pleasure , the cinematic equivalent of great beach reading . . . and what better way is there to describe the work of elmore leonard ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.9

"to go back and see what that city is like now , should be interesting , especially since there is very little media coverage of saigon that reaches main street america . this rather sentimental elegy to his country , plays much like a travelogue , bent on painting a pretty picture of the country despite the sad tale it tells of four diverse , gentle souls , whose symbolic fictionalized venture will prove to be very touching , as we follow them around saigon and observe them as their lives sometimes interact with each other . what the film lacks is a real poet's cutting edge and tension , and what is also astonishingly absent , is a view of the political situation . but what is even more astonishing , is the complete lack of anger from those who are poor , whose lives are so polarized from the very rich . there is little risk taken here by the director , who has shot a purposefully fictionalized account of vietnam , showing only that it is being swallowed up by capitalism and its own passivity . the coca-cola signs and the luxurious hotels serve only as reminders that this country is being overtaken by commercialism and greed , nevertheless the director seems content to film his picturesque view of the city , as is , of these materialistic intrusions appearing without any kind of analysis as to why . the pastel colors of the film and the brightness of the city , allow even the squalid slum section of town to appear to be picture perfect . another symbolic message , this time relating to their country and how it must learn to love itself without being gobbled up by foreigners . the season is summer and it is extremely hot . everything gets tidied up in nice little packages by the film's end and every one walks away enchanted , and this very picturesque take on saigon , that seems to be a love affair the director is having with his ancestral country , turns out to be an irksome charmer to behold . it lacks what it thinks it has : poetic vision . there is not much substance in its lyrics , and its beauty can only be taken as skin deep . when we think about what this film was saying , there is not much there that is perceptive enough to add something worthwhile to its lugubrious tale . the plain truth is , that there was just nothing striking said during this well-crafted film to hold our attention . it was mostly an arty kind of mush , fed to a western audience that is dying to see something nice about vietnam , even if that something can't get past being sentimental jive . the clich ? d story had too many coincidences and improbabilities in it , and an incomplete picture of how this city now functions , for its story to be considered as being relevant to the topic it covered , except by those who are pleased and willing to see something about vietnam that lets them forget about the war and the terrible conflicts it brought to both countries .",0.4
"michael apted , director of absolutely the best documentary series ever made ( 42 up and its predecessors ) , as well a wide variety of feature films from coal miner's daughter to the world is not enough , examines the world of the scientist in me & isaac newton . the result is completely engrossing , and the film is equally accessible to the scientific literates and illiterates . although the comparisons to errol morris's fast , cheap & out of control are obvious , apted takes a completely different approach to the art of the documentary . unlike morris , who relishes humor in all forms , apted uses it sparingly . still , apted isn't above including footage of intelligence-test taking pigeons and of old flash gordon adventures . frankly , fewer would have been better . in a film in which few criticisms are possible , the only other one would be that a final section that mixes politics with doomsday views of the future feels like little more than remarkably unscientific speculation . "" this was more fascinating that any murder mystery , "" he explains , breathlessly . as he zooms across the ice , he says that it is "" just me and isaac newton . "" one beautifully simple example we are shown is the use of a cheap ultraviolet light for purifying water in third world nations . at our screening , gadgil told us that they interviewed many scientists before they chose these seven . also at our screening , mataric said that journalists come to her lab all of time , usually asking nothing but inane and shallow questions such as , "" will robots take over the world ?

"dennis schwartz "" movie reviews and poetry "" whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up , as the director stated it is , is unimportant ; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months , featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves , concerned with getting older and still being single . their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical . that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with , does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told , one that has many implications on our culture , relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world . the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama , a "" rear window "" for singles . this time it is not a crime that we see , but is a voyeurist's delight , and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home , as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn't see . but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film , which is really not a documentary , except in its style . this could be a personal ad about her , if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love ( she can have sex whenever she wants to ) , but for monetary reasons . michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four , except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals . he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex . he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be . though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave . this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary .",0.7

"the movie is set in concord , mass . in what appears to be somewhere between say 1800 and 1890 . i lied . these five perfect females have a few males around them at times for decoration , but it is the women's show . the acting is all incredibly shallow , but this is a fault of the script they were given . the characters are two dimensional stick figures . they do absolutely no wrong . if they had made them more believable and less sugary sweet , one could have cared about them when tragedy struck . as it was , i just felt like the script was being manipulative . yes , maybe this is a problem with the book as well . frankly , i do not remember the novel that well . it seemed like half of her dialog were sermons on the need for female equality . i had no problem with what she was saying , but it was delivered so preachy that it seemed stilted and unreal . i found myself wondering if the book gave this subject so much emphasis or if this was a little revisionist writing . on the good side , you have never seen more lovely scenes of new england snow ( actually filmed in victoria , canada ) . curier and ives could not have done it better . the cinematography inside was equally stunning with wonderful warm candlelight glow yet bright enough to be able to see things well . finally , i loved the last minute of the show . the outdoor images there were striking and almost moving . the movie runs way too long at 1 : 50 . i lost track of how many times i looked at my watch wondering how much longer i had to sit there and endure it . it is rated pg but should have been g since there is no sex , nudity , violence or even a single gosh darn . the only reason for the pg rating is that some of the themes ( sickness and death ) are more mature . i do not recommend this show to anyone . nevertheless , i suspect there is a large audience for this movie especially among girls from say 10 to 16 . i give it * 1/2 strictly for the setting and the cinematography . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 28 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.4
"this is one of those films that you feel ashamed you saw . the characters appear to be not as bad as they seem , or as good as they seem--they just seem to be vapid . it is a film that has no direction or sense of what it wants to say , except to look good like commercials do and with the hope that it can be accepted as a "" feel good "" movie by the kind of public that will see anything in the summer as long as the film moves fast . everything about this film is a sham , from the repulsive bar it highlights to the inane relationship it features . it felt like i was dropped into a pit with some of the most obnoxious types you would ever want to meet and was told that the only way to get out of this trap , was to shake my ass like they do . his role is to be an adult , crack some jokes , try to give the film a heart , and not to seem too embarrassed when he is reduced to shaking his ass on top of that ugly frathouse dream bar the film has created to do its flashdance formula film again , but this time without fresh music or script . his only noteworthy habit is collecting rare comic books . because of all the trickery involved , doubles for the bargirls were used . it seems odd to have only one enforcer in a place that is built for trouble , but then again , hardly anything about this film made sense . but , i'd like to see violet try and convince anyone who is not brain dead that this film has a modicum of intelligence in it . an actor could only hope to come out of a film like this unscathed , that piper perabo does , is a credit to her , which is probably due to the innocent kindergarten teacher look she conveys . the film received a pg rating , despite its image of a bar from hell . but there are no hot sex scenes to satisy an audience it might be appealing to . . . i haven't a clue who this movie will please , but it sure isn't me .",0.2
"with its whimsical music and its bright colors set against a hazy background , the movie wants to be savored as a sweet fairytale for adults . working from joanne harris's novel , screenwriter robert nelson jacobs creates a script that is little more than a sketch , a problem that he had in his last effort , disney's poorly plotted dinosaur . jacobs throws in a myriad of slightly quirky characters that give us some reasons to smile but rarely to laugh . some of the townsfolk find that a chocolate fix is better than viagra , so they buy it in bulk . even the dogs are aroused by its consumption . our audience found the funniest scene to be that of two dogs , doing it well , doggie style . the fact that canine sex produces the movie's largest laugh is proof that the script needs some major surgery . johnny depp , who usually infuses any role with an intriguing energy , plays his part of a river rat , an irish gypsy , with good looks and little more . he seemed to be posing for the movie's promotion stills and didn't realize that the director had called , "" action ! "" after lots of chocolate eating and a few nice little moments , the movie throws in a couple of predictable tragedies to invoke some quick tears in the audience before it rolls the ending credits . the only thing you might remember about the film a day later is one of its chocolate confections . eat a chocolate ; skip the movie . chocolat runs 2 : 01 . regardless of what the title and the setting might lead you to belief , the film is in english , not french . it is rated pg-13 for a scene of sensuality and some violence and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . most kids , however , are likely to be bored .",0.5
"this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story . whatever badii is searching for , this basically is still a philosophical movie , that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn't been prescribed to them . it also indirectly asks the question , why would any one in good health and being sane , want to kill themselves . if i reply , help me out of the hole . if i don't , cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt . we don't really know the reason mr . badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life , except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job , that you don't know how someone else feels , you may be able to sympathize with them , but you could never understand their pain . but again , we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide , to the director it is obviously not that important , or else he would have provided us with more information . he probably thought like i did , at first , that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up . again , the contrast between the men' silence and the noise from their work is explored . but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears . mr . bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle . then he asks badii , don't you want to taste the cherry ? don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset , and the stars and the moon ? as he offers logical reasons for staying alive , that are indisputable . kiarostami' point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state . films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories , is what the director is now telling us , since questions are more important to him , than anything else , they make us think harder about the things we do . my thought about the death of the linear film , as pronounced by the director , is that , if all you did was ask questions , as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself , you would still end up being the idiot questioner , if that is all you did , question everything , because somewhere along the line , if you are honest with yourself , you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe , and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format , and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made . why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking , at least for this film , could have something to do with iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances , that if he openly criticized them , it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore . i'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films , as being the vade mecum of filmmaking , you just try to do what you can , if the film has a magic to it , it will work . i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out , you don't know for sure if mr . badii committed suicide or not , but it also took the air out of the story's power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you , first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word . kiarostami was having fun with the audience , and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes , then you might have thought like i did , that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having , with my imagination working on all cylinders , stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised ; and , by ending the film on that false note , and shooting it on video instead of film , it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in , as i originally thought it was . if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film , that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing , then he miscalculated how i felt . but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously , a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life ( and at film ) , and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us . and , in any case , i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers , that sometimes i don't like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing . so i'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will be subject to change , that is , if that is meant to be so .",0.8
"their relationship becomes the heart of the film , rather than the mystery story . the film's main asset is that it is played as a psychological character study of the jane fonda character , who becomes a prostitute because she can control men and is good at it . their love affair which emerges unexpectantly , is unsettling to both of them , but real feelings develop on both sides , to the surprise of each , and how they resolve it , is what gives this film its bit of magic . the film takes us into bree's world of pimps , high-rollers , prostitutes , and drug-addicts , a world klute thinks is pathetic . these scenes were too predictable and offered no real insight into that underground world of prostitution , leaving many dry spells in the thin story line . jane fonda did get into the head of an intelligent call-girl who is searching for answers to her life , enough so she won a best actress oscar for her performance , though i thought she was at times shrill and played the role with too much of a calculated effort . i actually preferred donald sutherland's contrasting role , even though the film wasn't about him , i thought his normalcy was harder to convey than her hipster role . it was a film about conflicts over emotional involvement and independence , whereas i thought fonda could recover more easily from this tragic part of her life than sutherland could . klute was fresh when it came out in the 1970s , but time has taken away much of its boldness . even the semi-nude scenes are very tame by today's standards .",0.5
"it sets a high standard for submarine films , as a well-crafted , serious work , that created a lot of nail-biting tension and evoked a suspenseful atmosphere , and might very well be the best submarine film ever made . wolfgang petersen was nominated but did not win an oscar for his directing . it also gave the director a chance to come to hollywood to show off his ability to shoot action films , where he made "" in the line of fire "" / "" air force one "" / "" perfect storm .

"during one fifteen minute sequence in mission : impossible , i was reminded of what a masterful director of suspense brian depalma can be when he is on his game . as cruise attempts to download files and get out of the booby-trapped room safely , depalma creates the kind of suspense that most directors of action only dream about -- you're wondering not only _if_ cruise will be caught , but which alarm will go off first . the cia set piece is crisply edited , and set up and executed with skill and flair . for those fifteen minutes , depalma is a genius again , and mission : impossible is all you could ask a summer adventure-thriller to be . it's telling that you won't see depalma's name anywhere in the advertising campaign for mission : impossible -- he's obviously not considered much of a selling point -- but it's the kind of job that can put a guy back on the a-list . what a shame that with the exception of those furiously tense fifteen minutes , depalma seems to be spending most of his time on damage control . the film is full of cockeyed angles , extreme close-ups , flashbacks and slow-motion , as depalma tries to create the illusion that somewhere buried in all the busy detail of plot , something is actually at stake in mission : impossible . just to demonstrate that i understand the point of mission : impossible , i will observe that it is a premise , a property , a franchise , an identifiable name to be exploited . it is an espionage thriller which comes conveniently after goldeneye has demonstrated that there is still a market for espionage thrillers , and it is yet another escapist entertainment like twister which treats story and character as luxury items not afforded by budgets in the neighborhood of $70 million ( a very comfortable neighborhood ) . there are scenes throughout the film which suggest that we're supposed to find the relationships between people relevant in some way , and instead i found myself scratching my head and wondering where , precisely , i was supposed to have picked up that information . even depalma makes several puzzling choices during the film , including an ill-advised sequence which shows us through flashback that hunt knows someone is lying to him , making a scene which comes later thoroughly anti-climactic . still , he seems most of the time to be trying his best with a script by david koepp and robert towne ( and which featured story assistance from steven zaillian ) which is both simplistic in premise and ridiculously convoluted and confusing in the execution . there is one extremely well-handled and unexpected development quite early in the film , and it offers the hope that mission : impossible is going to avoid the predictability bug . however , at its heart mission : impossible is about one real question -- who is the real traitor -- and i found myself waiting for the inevitable revelation through a morass of ridiculous leaps of logic . mission : impossible's two other action set pieces will certainly have their fans , and there are moments of excitement and cleverness in both of them . but i found the opening sequence brutally edited , and if you've seen any trailers or commercials for the film ( and how could you miss them ) , you've seen the best moment in the big high-speed train finale . no , there is only one real reason to see mission : impossible , and that is those fifteen precious minutes when you are reminded that a scene without special effects can be gripping because it was put together by a superb craftsman , a director who can momentarily make you forget about a sloppy script , and make you care about the fate of cardboard cutouts .",0.5

"so , friendless and alone , halfway across the world , dev experiences culture shock--he may look like an indian , but it is quickly and vividly demonstrated that looks are of little consequence , and it will take more than a glib tongue and an unwillingness to back down to earn acceptance and respect . unsurprisingly , those incidents typically lead to embarrassment or worse . stories about clashing cultures are nothing new to movies . like praying with anger , both of those movies deal with friction between indian and american traditions . these scenes , which make up a majority of the first half of praying with anger , are often fascinating . shyamalan doesn't reveal anything extraordinary , but neither does he shrink from showing the often-painful rigidity imposed by india's caste divisions . social class is very much an issue , both as it applies to dev and the people that he comes to care about . unfortunately , the basic plot is a series of formulas neatly bundled together . praying with anger lacks originality and inspiration , and after the initial interest has worn off , the story has a hard time holding the viewer's attention . it's always apparent what's around the next corner , and the one after that as well . shyamalan occasionally has problems with dialogue . most of the time , the lines are okay , but there are moments when he launches into jarring , overblown sermon-like lectures . we do not , for example , need to have it explicitly and repeatedly pointed out how beautiful the traditions of india are when the camerawork places them adequately on display . like the dialogue , the characters are uneven . at times , the people in praying with anger seem real , but there are occasions when they become foils for the plot . dev's sudden and complete transformation in the film's final act is difficult to swallow , especially since we are never presented with enough evidence to justify such a radical swing in point-of-view . to the credit of m . night shyamalan , he strove for something lavish and ambitious in this , his first effort . while praying with anger is not a total success , there are enough glimpses of promise to indicate that shyamalan may have a fine future in film making . however , beyond those brief-but-sterling moments , praying with anger relies on too much stock material for it to be satisfying enough to warrant more than a passing interest .",0.5
"inertia . the dictionary defines it as "" a property of matter by which it remains at rest or in uniform motion , "" and this is an apt descriptor for paul thomas anderson's debut feature , hard eight . during the first half , virtually nothing happens -- the characters are stuck in a stasis from which escape seems impossible . then , during the second half , momentum carries the story to its inescapable conclusion . the dualistic nature of hard eight makes it a difficult picture to size up . at times , it's engrossing , but , on other occasions , it's a lesson in frustration . hard eight opens with a fascinating , twenty-minute prologue . sydney's scam is deceptively simple and undeniably effective , and anderson presents it with flair and an undercurrent of wry humor . hard eight borrows its share of conventions from noir thrillers , but this is more of a character drama than anything else . i said earlier that portions of hard eight are frustrating . indeed , some scenes are almost painful to watch because of everyone's inability to act decisively . people talk and talk and talk , but the words don't mean anything , and nothing gets resolved . characters frequently speak in an elliptical manner , taking forever to get to the point . it's the inertia thing . there's a palpable reluctance to change to status quo . anyone expecting the high-octane , pop-saturated drive of pulp fiction will be disappointed . hard eight is a different sort of movie altogether . in fact , it owes more to films like the music of chance than to tarantino's effort . the dialogue is rich but never glib , and the characters , all pictures of loneliness in one way or another , are carefully drawn and developed . in fact , about the only elements pulp fiction and hard eight have in common are stylistic similarities grounded in the noir tradition and effective performances by the always- solid samuel l . jackson . jackson is great , as is gwyneth paltrow , but those two only have supporting roles . the core of hard eight , and the reason to see it , is the dynamic between philip baker hall's sydney and john c . reilly's john . though sydney exudes a confident , assured manner , it doesn't take long for us to recognize the desperation and loneliness eating away at him from within . hall brings this out subtlety , through a carefully- modulated performance that will linger in the mind long after the details of hard eight's minimalist plot have faded . hard eight perhaps teases us with more than it delivers . the casino scenes have a sense of energy and verisimilitude that isn't always present when the action switches to swank hotel room and sleazy dives . yet there's something almost hypnotic about the way hard eight develops -- even in its slowest , most tedious moments , it keeps our attention . and , at a time when independent films are relying ever more on comfortable formulas , that's something of an accomplishment .",0.7
"screenplay : jonathan hensleigh and j . j . abrams . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 150 minutes . you gotta give bonus points to the touchstone pictures publicity department for uncommon candor on the subject of big-budget film screenwriting . after creating an additional writing credit to accommodate two more names ( "" adaptation "" on top of "" story "" and "" screenplay , "" as if you could figure out the difference ) , jerry bruckheimer and touchstone appear to have publicly embraced the concept of pot-luck screenwriting : the notion that if a dozen different guys all bring something to the table , you end up with a cinematic meal . the subject , of course , is this summer's favorite -- a huge celestial body on a collision course with our big blue marble , this one an asteroid the size of texas . it's enough to generate flashbacks from deep impact , where the feeble attempts to generate sweeping emotion more often generated sleeping emotion . armageddon , to its credit , at least gets its priorities straight . make no mistake , this is a special effects-driven action film , chock-a-block with ahhh-inspiring scenes -- exploding space shuttles , meteor showers toppling the empire state building , the gargoyles on the notre dame cathedral watching as paris is reduced to baguette crumbs . director michael bay predictably resorts to tension-builders like close shaves with countdown clocks , but at least he knows enough to keep the focus on the drill team's mission once they're in space . for its final 75 minutes , armageddon is virtually nothing but explosions , crashes and narrow escapes . . . and that's a good thing . it's the _first_ 75 minutes which truly test your gag reflex , as the aforementioned cadre of writers tries vainly to create the illusion of character development . stock interpersonal conflicts share time with tender moments as all involved make their peace before heading off to save humanity ; i'm not sure whether i was more moved by the gruff reconciliation between grace and harry , or a . j . wooing grace using animal crackers for foreplay ( don't ask ) . it's all a load of nonsense , made even less interesting by bay's foolish decision to keep chopping back and forth between the playful introduction of our roughneck protagonists and a solemn war room session at nasa . there's nothing cohesive or compelling about armageddon as narrative ; strangely enough , it feels like the result of a dozen different writers contributing individual scenes or lines of dialogue . i'm not going to suggest that armageddon isn't a pretty effective diversion . if there's one thing a dozen writers can do , it's produce a bunch of solid laughs and craft a few exciting action sequences . there's just not much more you can expect from a film where they seem more interested in throwing in a godzilla gag than in letting one writer create an actual story . for all the uneven visceral enjoyment that it's worth , touchstone pictures proudly presents armageddon : a blockbuster a la carte . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"safe passage opens with an eerie sequence of blurred faces , off-color images , and an inexorable , building darkness . while this may function as an effective tool to introduce all the characters , it comes across as unbelievably contrived , and doesn't get proceedings started on a solid footing . when safe passage works , it does so because it dares to be more honest than most similarly-themed dramas . when it fails , however , which it does nearly as often , it's because the story falls back on cliches and formulas . at the core of the picture is yet another cinematic dysfunctional family . and still there is no definite word . . . . as occasionally involving as safe passage is , there's really nothing special or memorable about either the story or the performances . it's not that the actors do bad jobs--they're all quite competent , in fact--but no one stands out . there's nothing here that dozens of others in hollywood couldn't have done as well . one of the strengths of safe passage is its willingness to permit conversations to go on beyond the expected "" motion picture "" length . not only does this lend an air of verisimilitude to what the characters are saying , but it sometimes leads to a deeper understanding of motivations . this script has no fear of wordy dialogue . on the other hand , the plot is littered with worn-out conceits . one character dozes off while another is making a painful confession . the presence of so many characters is probably a mistake , because no one gets the screen time necessary to be developed beyond the sketch stage . while it's always pleasant to see accomplished performers like sarandon , shepard , and leonard , safe passage doesn't give them much chance to show us anything new . the premise is interesting , and there's a fair amount of promise in the subject matter , but somehow , the movie never quite meets expectations . not enough pieces are missing to automatically disregard safe passage . it may be a fairly mundane film with lapses of unoriginality weakening its moments of insight , but there's still something oddly compelling about this group of oddball characters crammed together in front of the television , watching and waiting .",0.6
"cast : jean-paul belmondo , michel boujenah , alessandra martines , salome lelouch director : claude lelouch producer : claude lelouch screenplay : claude lelouch , inspired by the novel by victor hugo cinematography : clause lelouch music : francis lai , philippe servain , erik berchot , michel legrand , and didier barbelivien u . s . distributor : warner brothers in french with english subtitles claude lelouch's les miserables is one of the year's motion picture triumphs : an epic drama that takes the themes of victor hugo's novel and transplants them to the twentieth century . rather than merely re- telling a story that has previously been brought to life in a variety of different incarnations ( including a hugely popular musical ) , lelouch has chosen to take ideas , plot strings , and themes from the novel and apply them in a unique and tremendously effective manner to the greatest tragedy of this century : world war ii and hitler's final solution . as the story-within-the-story unfolds--complete with filmed scenes lifted directly from the novel--henri is enraptured , seeing parallels in his own life to both les miserables' jean valjean and cosette . those familiar with les miserables will immediately recognize the boundless symbols and references--some subtle , some obvious . those who have never read the book , seen a previous filmed version , or experienced the musical will not be left floundering , however . lelouch re-tells enough of the original that a person would have to be blind not to see the interconnections . it's difficult to emphasize what lelouch has accomplished with this movie . no film that i'm familiar with has so ably intersected a classical novel with a modern tale . it's been tried , most frequently with shakespeare , but never has the result been such an unqualified success . this version of les miserables is a masterpiece precisely because it doesn't merely regurgitate hugo's tale . it's something simultaneously new and timeless . above all , les miserables is a story of the indomitable nature of the human spirit . despite the title and its attendant images of misery , poverty , injustice , and oppression ( all of which are present in one form or another ) , the movie is a decidedly uplifting experience , because its concentration is on the power to overcome . to be sure , there's much evil in this world , but there's good as well . lelouch re-uses actors to underscore the parallels between hugo's book and his own story . numerous other actors do similar multi-character duty . then , there are times when clips from a previous , black-and- white version of les miserables are artfully intersected with lelouch's all-color images . although belmondo's performance is towering , his co-stars are exceptional enough not to be reduced to scenery . michel boujenah and alessandra martines are more than capable of holding up their corners of the story , but the real find is young salome lelouch , an impressive young actress who deserves more exposure in future features . as in nikita mikhalkov's burnt by the sun ( where the director's granddaughter had a key role ) , this is a rare instance when nepotism uncovers an acting gem . themes echo and resonate through every minute of the nearly-three hour picture . the director is constantly reminding us that what makes a story great , whatever the medium chosen for its telling , is that in it we see ourselves and people we know . nowhere is this more true than in les miserables . whether hugo's , lelouch's , or both , you will rarely find a more powerful , cathartic , and ultimately satisfying narrative to immerse yourself in .",0.95

"" i wish i was an oscar meyer wiener "" is a big hit . it's about as meaningless to talk about acting as characterization . sandra bullock proves just how silly her dialogue is . and denis leary is denis leary , doing his slick fast-talking routine and seeming completely out of place ( you keep waiting for the multi-nicknamed deion sanders to show up ) . yes , this film is worse than cliffhanger , stallone's last venture into chaos . and , while i'm not one to leap forward and extol the limitless virtues of total recall , that motion picture is a masterpiece in comparison to this one . at least there , the future was believable . here , it's a hopelessly cliched place where the explosions can conveniently be boosted by a few nifty ( but not especially original ) special effects . in the end , that's all this film is : flames , flying bullets , and special effects . it could be worse , i suppose , but as long as people go into this film with their eyes open , there shouldn't be any surprises .",0.34

"i suppose one could find some sociological significance to the glut of recent films about inattentive parents and neglected children , if one were inclined to give a cliche a more grandiose label . from whoopi goldberg in bogus to arnold schwarzenegger in jingle all the way , from tim allen in the santa clause to tim allen in jungle2jungle , the reformed workaholic has become the most popular protagonist in formula comedies , going through a series of wacky adventures before giving a big hug to a sad-eyed son or daughter . jim carrey is the latest star to step into this vehicle , and he certainly has enough pure manic energy to give is some spark , but he has to work awfully hard to do it . liar liar is a pure show-off showcase for carrey , and by sheer force of will he makes it funny , despite a ridiculously limp script which has only one place to go . i have this theory that the script for liar liar , credited to paul guay and stephen mazur , consisted largely of parenthetical gaps which read something like "" jim does some weird physical stuff here "" or "" jim makes a goofy face . "" there is a staggering lack of creativity in liar liar given the possibilities of the premise . carrey is trapped in one situation -- the courtroom -- for far too long , and that situation begins to look like an extended homage to steve martin's work in all of me , but without martin's ability to maintain his dignity . the dialogue consists largely of one fairly obvious put-downs after another , most of which are salvaged by carrey's priceless reaction takes and his futile attempts to control his honesty . it seems fairly evident that without carrey , liar liar would have been an utter catastrophe . with him , it manages some genuine comic high notes . carrey seems to realize that the entire film is riding on his shoulders , and he plays it that way , as though the other people in the film were scenery to be swallowed or knocked out of the way . for all practical purposes they are , particularly in the aforementioned partners' meeting , where a dozen people sit around a table for the express purpose of being skewered ; carrey often seems to be performing for the rest of the cast as well as for the audience . only cary elwes , in a subtle turn as audrey's painfully earnest boyfriend , lends any support at all . as long as carrey remains in overdrive , liar liar provides fairly consistent moderate laughs -- as well as a few big ones -- but the entire enterprise feels compromised by the tired paternal redemption motif . it almost spoils the fun of watching carrey do his best impression of a human pinball , knowing that eventually he's going to have to break down in a tearful proclamation of devotion to his son . it's too bad that , with carrey on board and a fanciful concept at the ready , liar liar can't work up an inspired story to match carrey's inspired performance . in fact , it can barely work up enough material to fill 90 minutes , resorting to end-credit out-takes to pad the running time . she may be right , but thank heaven someone involved in liar liar was working as hard as all these single-minded screen parents we've been seeing lately .",0.6
"few of us who call ourselves "" adults "" truly remember the experience of childhood , except as a dim and distant illusion . oh , we can recall what we did as a child , and often our memories of that period are among our most precious , but , looking back , we view things through the haze of maturity . every once in a while , however , something comes along that breaks through that filter -- a movie , a scene on television , a page in a book , or a moment in real life . jacques doillon's ponette is one such catalyst . by presenting the world through the eyes of a grieving four- year old , ponette manages to do what few motion pictures can -- regress an audience into childhood . i would place ponette in the company of two other recent films that have successfully attempted something similar : dorota kedzierzawska's crows and rebecca miller's angela . in both of those movies , however , the protagonist was older ( 9 in crows , 10 in angela ) , and neither featured a young actress with as much emotional power as victoire thivisol , who plays the title character in this film . ponette works in large part because of its simplicity and realism . the plot is minimal -- just enough to give us a reason to stay with the tiny protagonist for ninety minutes . the film effortlessly takes us into the magical world of a four- year old , where stuffed animals have extraordinary powers , dolls are more than inanimate objects , and god is someone you can talk to and expect an answer from . some of the most memorable moments in ponette center around the innocent conversations of children -- how catholics are different from jews , what it means to be "" single "" , and how eating a certain candy can make you fall in love forever . for more than eighty minutes , ponette continues strongly , but , in the end , writer/director jacques doillon seems at a loss how to end the movie . his choice , while admittedly cathartic , feels like a cheat . the pseudo-realistic , almost-documentary quality of the film evaporates ; ponette's final scenes jar us out of the fragile reverie generated by what preceded them . fortunately , the contrived ending does little to dampen my enthusiasm for the picture as a whole . when i recall ponette , the first thing i think of is the heartbreakingly pure performance of young victoire thivisol . this is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an actor of any age , but , from someone who's only four , it's astonishing . a share of the credit must be lavished upon doillon -- it takes a masterful film maker to elicit this kind of unforced performance from a child . had thivisol shown a hint of artifice , ponette would not have worked . the strength and consistency of her acting keeps this film on a high level . even if the movie was not so moving and evocative , it would be worth viewing simply for the character that thivisol brings to life .",0.75

"" i needn't say which path sonia chooses , because , like almost everything else in this movie , it's easily guessed . one of the most disappointing aspects of a price above rubies is its lack of originality ? right down to the too-pat conclusion . the premise has a great deal of potential , little of which is realized . instead of fashioning a gallery of interesting , multi-dimensional characters around sonia , yakin is content to plunder a bag of types . that's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg , however . one of the most potentially-fascinating elements of a price above rubies is the opportunity it affords for an exploration of the hasidic society . a price above rubies makes the not-dissimilar hasidic people look cartoonish by comparison . yakin's casting choices are also questionable . christopher eccleston , who was impressive as the title character in 1996's jude , is flat and unconvincing as sender . there's no passion or power in this performance ; it's a dull , lifeless rendering of a man who is supposed to be deeply devout . i'm not suggesting that eccleston should have gone down the route taken by robert duvall in the apostle , but a little more energy might have made sender seem less like a writer's construct and more like an individual . the flaw in renee zellweger's performance is harder to define . there are numerous instances when zellweger's intonations and accent are all wrong . it's the little things that are problematic . a price above rubies isn't a complete disaster . despite its obvious faults , the melodrama is never boring . my reservations about zellweger's performance don't alter the fact that sonia is an appealing protagonist , and it's not hard to identify with her struggles . unlike many of the other characters in the film , she is well-developed , although certain facets of her personality are built through clich ? s . so , although a price above rubies can be described as "" watchable , "" it stands as a mediocre exploration of one woman's attempts to express her individuality in a closed society .

"the pieces are familiar , but they don't quite fit together . extended , surrealistic , dialogue-free musical interludes are used to advance character and set tone . campy dialogue , gaudy costumes and ambiguous sexuality flourish . speculative romantic connections are established between roman-a-clef versions of pop music stars , accompanied by effectively pseudo-period new songs . it's citizen kane meets pink floyd the wall , the rocky horror picture show meets grace of my heart . and that's saying nothing of the suggestion that oscar wilde , the father of flamboyance , was an alien progeny . welcome to the evocative , provocative world of writer/director todd haynes , the man who used barbie dolls to tell the story of karen carpenter in the little-seen underground film superstar , and who fashioned a sublime , complex cautionary tale about environmental and psychological collapse in safe . in velvet goldmine , a fictionalized account of the early 70s glam rock scene , haynes takes a somewhat appropriate style over substance approach . the center of the story is the rise and fall of ziggy stardust . . . i velvet goldmine is less a narrative than it is a long-form music video , intriguing images full of manufactured outrageousness ( including the bizarre oscar wilde prologue ) . as such , it certainly re-creates its era effectively . the music , the mood and the theatricality are all pure glam ; rhys meyers looks perfectly the part as pop creation already beginning to eat itself . but haynes piles stylish surface on top of stylish surface in velvet goldmine until it never quite gets at the heart of anything -- not the artists , not the appeal of glam , not even whether the scene was about social change or filthy lucre . it certainly comes awfully close on occasion . in one wonderfully cross-cut sequence , arthur's sexual awakening is connected to the sexual excesses of slade's entourage , suggesting that even in their self-absorption the glam rockers -- often tormented as children for their sexual individuality -- succeeded at expanding boundaries for other youth . yet even this storyline spins into an absurd , pointless conspiracy-mystery which arthur could have put together only by actually viewing footage from the film we're watching . that's the kind of infatuation with his own film-making that haynes displays in velvet goldmine . because it's always visually engrossing , it keeps holding out the hope that it's going somewhere substantial . instead , it offers the cinematic equivalent of hip-hop sampling , turning into a montage of visual and musical cues from other pieces of popular cinema ; haynes even cribs from superstar with a romantic scene between two dolls . if glam was somehow about the fine line between profound and shallow , haynes has hit the mark dead on . this is one deliberately confounding spectacle . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"the recipe for the phantom is the result of the kind of perverse logic which produces some of hollywood's most spectacular flops . there is a super-hero in a form-fitting costume , because the people seemed to love it in superman and batman ; there is derring-do in the 1930s involving mysterious and powerful relics , because the people seemed to love it in the indiana jones films ; there is a nasty industrialist and a feisty heroine because , well , the people always seem to love that . in short , the phantom is an action-adventure frankenstein's monster , cobbled together from pieces of other much better films -- and then nobody remembered to give it a jolt of energy . if the phantom resembles any other recent attempt at cinematic super-heroism , it is 1994's bomb the shadow . it is a film which never once carves out for itself a distinct theme -- too straight most of the time to be camp , and too dumb to work as a rousing adventure . wincer likes to let his stories unfold at a leisurely pace , but there isn't much of a story to unfold in the phantom . that leaves him with action set pieces which are slow , perfunctory , and lacking a unique flavor . the phantom feels like the work of a director who simply never had an idea about what to do with the material . to be fair to wincer , that appears to be true of the cast as well . similarly , megalomania has never seemed as charming and unthreatening as it does coming from treat williams , in one of the least interesting villain performances in recent memory . when cary-hiroyuki tagawa turns up as pirate lord kabai sengh nearly 90 minutes into the phantom , i found myself utterly stumped as to why he wasn't the primary bad guy , since at least he had charisma . and pity poor kristy swanson , trying so hard to be a spunky liberated woman that she never bothers to notice that she doesn't have a character to play . rarely have i seen a so-called adventure film in which so many participants seemed to be going through the motions like basketball players on the wrong side of a blow-out , wrestling with a thoroughly synthetic script . jeffrey boam ( indiana jones and the last crusade , lethal weapon 2 & 3 ) knows how to work with established characters in an established formula , and that's the way he approaches the phantom : as though we already know the drill , he's just filling in the blanks , and the phantom character's status as antecedent to modern action films shields it from charges of wholesale theft . but it simply isn't the case that his audience is essentially familiar with the phantom .",0.3

"when it comes to favorite christmas tales on the screen , there are probably two . there's no confusion about the first , because there is only one it's a wonderful life . in fact , frank capra's classic is so expertly wrought that no one has even attempted a big screen remake . the second is a little more problematic , because there have been many worthy takes on charles dickens' a christmas carol . in 1984 , george c . scott humbugged to memorable effect in a made-for-tv adaptation . but the best-loved and most-remembered version of a christmas carol has to be the 1951 edition of scrooge , with the inimitable alastair sim as london's cruelest miser . sim , a veteran of british stage and screen , started his motion picture career in the mid-'30s and ended it in the early-'70s . sim is not just one of many actors to play the part -- for everyone who has seen the crisply-made black-and-white production , he is the definitive scrooge . at the film's opening , sim radiates cold ; at the end , his giddy exuberance is contagious . in between , we experience many emotions directed towards his character : sadness , anger , and , most strongly , pity . sim makes us feel for scrooge in a way that no other actor has been capable of . take away the lead actor , and this version of scrooge would still have been a credible reworking , with capable performances , a strong atmosphere , and superior costume and set design . the movie was made on an english soundstage in the early 1950s , but the look is of london a century earlier . today , with modern special effects , this would not be as great an achievement as it was more than forty years ago . the black- and-white cinematography , brilliantly achieved by c . pennington- richards , is as crucial to the film's success as any other individual element . rather than making scrooge seem quaint and outdated , the black-and-white approach lends it a sense of eerieness and mystery that no color version has managed to recapture . the plot is faithful to dickens' original tale . ebeneezer scrooge is easily one of the nastiest men in london . sim is supported by an able cast , many of whom are familiar faces . kathleen harrison , whose mrs . dilber was scrooge's comic highlight , had a similarly impressive resume . only michael dolan was hardly ever heard from again . like all uplifting christmas stories , scrooge ends with a flurry of good will and high spirits . but the chief pleasure of watching this version of a christmas carol is not the ending . at a reasonably short 85 minutes , this is nevertheless a complete experience , and the strength and depth of its drama makes it the most memorable of any adaptation of the tale . we may hum along with albert finney , hiss at bill murray , and smile at scrooge mcduck , but none of them compares favorably to sim . when it comes to a christmas carol , perhaps there isn't much of a question about the best version after all ? - ingmar bergman",0.8
"director : steve miner . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . the film was john carpenter's halloween , a low-budget phenomenon which launched the much-loathed but immensely profitable "" teen slasher "" genre . masked and/or mutilated maniacs proliferated , the numbers on the sequels clicking by faster than the number of customers served by mcdonald's . it's no wonder dimension films tagged the sub-title twenty years later on halloween h20 ; they probably feared viewers would actually think this was the 20th film in the series . this sequel , of course , is banking on something a bit more than name recognition to draw viewers : nostalgia . if you've ever wondered what surviving the carnage of a teen slasher movie would do to someone , here's your answer . that effective bit of back story carries halloween h20 over the pitfalls of genre convention which even executive producer kevin williamson -- the post-modernist horror connoisseur behind scream and scream 2 -- can't quite shake off . the one thing williamson and director steve miner _do_ bring to the proceedings is a bit more understated menace . surprisingly , every encounter between michael and an unfortunate stranger does not result in an impromptu ginzu aeration . this killer's singularity of purpose , combined with some well-crafted set-pieces , allows this halloween to score more points with tension than it does with shock value . clearly it also scores on the basis of its climactic showdown . laurie's resourcefulness in the original halloween made her an uncommon screen heroine , and the same quality is present this time around . it's actually here that williamson's sensibility shows through most obviously ; playing on genre expectations , halloween h20 shows laurie not trusting anything as mundane as a body bag to guarantee that michael won't be back to continue tormenting her in halloween h21 . the return of laurie strode could have been a cheap publicity stunt . instead , it's a genuinely effective recognition of the original's influence . though too conventional to be truly thrilling , halloween h20 is a fitting final round for one of screen history's bloodiest family feuds . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.6

"screenplay : alan zweibel and jessie nelson . director : rob reiner . it is a wonderfully affecting moment , beautifully performed by pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that makes up a marriage . it's also a moment that is a complete cheat . theoretically , the story of us is the story of how easy it is , in the middle of all the white noise and tension of everyday life , to lose track of why you fell in love with someone in the first place . unfortunately , it's such a fragmented narrative that it's just as easy for the _audience_ to lose track of why they fell in love in the first place . the script by alan zweibel and jessie nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the jordan's separation -- a peek at their meeting and first date here , an interrupted dalliance on the butcher block there -- but there aren't nearly enough of them . the story of us spends virtually all its time showing us the relationship already in trouble , making it incredibly difficult to appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place . we're asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the jordans' marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed . it's even more frustrating to realize that the story of us is so solid at its core that it could have been wonderful . the film is not always a pleasant experience , showing off some extremely unfair fighting between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage seems beyond repair . willis and pfeiffer deftly turn their post-separation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair ; where most films treat divorce either as all-acrimony or all-indifference , this one captures how much people want it all to work out . but at only 92 minutes , the story of us feels bereft of context . somewhere on the cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple coexistence to a blur of petty bickering . if only more of the so-called humor had found its way to the same floor . wilson rants about how men never change the toilet paper roll , a gag that hasn't gotten any fresher since it was generated by bad stand-up comics 20 years ago . reiner waxes philosophical about how "" there is no ass , just the fleshy tops of your legs . "" reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a book about ben's grandparents , inspiring only stony silence from the audience . reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood they only end up breaking it , with little to show for their efforts but a few half-hearted chuckles . it's easy to see the comedy as part of reiner's attempt to create a companion piece to his 1989 gem when harry met sally . with its direct addresses to the camera and hairdo-change time lapses , the story of us does sometimes feel like when harry left sally . yet while this film was unlikely to be as purely entertaining , it could have been far more resonant . some of the individual scenes in the story of us are heartbreaking , and a few are truly charming . they just never quite add up to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis . it's easy to understand why those snippets would move katie to tears ; after all , she lived those moments . the story of us could have moved us all if only we'd been allowed to live them , too . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6

"leatrice is also responsible for popularizing the bobbed hair look , which was the style of her hair for this film . this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking . it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters : "" that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman .

"considering the wealth of material provided by the recent tragedy in bosnia , it's surprising that michael winterbottom's welcome to sarajevo is the first major western motion picture to take place in the war-torn country . it's possible to argue that the reason for this is that english-speaking directors are intimidated by the sheer scope and complexity of the conflict , and they somehow feel that any attempt on their part to chronicle even an aspect of the war would be inadequate . more likely , however , it's a pragmatic realization -- films about this particular subject are anathema to the public , and , because of that , they are likely to result in an anemic performance at the box-office . there are many possibilities why movie-goers would react negatively to a film about bosnia , but the most likely reason has its roots in the way the media covered the conflict . but , to keep viewers from turning to another channel , it was all sanitized . there was no sense of true horror ; this was half a world away . it didn't seem real , and the television coverage was edited in a manner designed to keep our repugnance at bay . yet , on some level , everyone recognized that something genuinely terrible was transpiring ; we just didn't want to understand the depth of it . so a movie that challenges us by revealing truths about this conflict threatens our comfort level in a way that schindler's list ( about events that happened 50 years ago ) never did . we don't want to know ; it's too unpleasant and disquieting . welcome to sarajevo isn't just the story of an outsider's perspective of the conflict ; it's a compelling examination of the role the media played in reporting and shaping the average person's views of the war . and , while there's nothing revolutionary or extraordinary about the dramatic narrative , the subtext gives winterbottom's movie its force . as a tale focused upon the horrors of war , welcome to sarajevo doesn't cover any new ground , but as an autopsy of what the conflict meant to a worldwide television audience , this is new and disturbing material . oddly enough , the film has as much in common with gus van sant's attack on television news , to die for , as it does with pictures like vukovar and pretty village , pretty flame . unlike those two films and numerous others that show the bosnian war from an insider's viewpoint , welcome to sarajevo makes its main character a british tv news reporter . the movie does not delve deeply into the reasons for the conflict , nor does it burden viewers with lengthy discourses on the centuries-old racial and religious strife . we witness the bodies , the carnage , and , most chillingly , concentration camp images that echo those seen in post-world war 2 photographs . the british newsman at the center of welcome to sarajevo is michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) , whose character is based on a real-life individual ( just as the movie's script was developed from the non- fictional account , "" natasha's story "" ) . throughout the film , we are given glimpses of the way the journalists on the scene report the news , and what becomes of their stories . one particularly graphic massacre is bumped from the top of the hour in favor of an item about the separation of the duke and duchess of york . it's all about ratings . information is less important than entertainment , and it's difficult to make such a grotesque , twisted war , where sniper fire kills innocent bystanders , entertaining . by using a combination of real archived video , faux video filmed specifically for this movie , and normal 35 mm footage , winterbottom creates a kaleidoscope of juxtaposed images . we're never sure what's true and what isn't -- whether a video of writhing , bloody bodies is genuine or a realistic recreation . this technique further illustrates how blurred the line has become between authentic , hard news and its controlled , entertainment-controlled counterpart . in previous films like go now and jude , winterbottom has shown a keen understanding of character and an unwillingness to toy with an audience's emotions through overt manipulation , and both of these characteristics are evident in welcome to sarajevo . stephen dillane is entirely believable as the lead , and woody harrelson , who is slowly developing into an effective dramatic performer , fleshes out flynn . welcome to sarajevo debuted at 1997's cannes film festival , where it received numerous plaudits but no awards . this impeccably-crafted movie is a daring and powerful piece of work , not only for its willingness to film an unpopular subject , but for the unique perspective it offers , and it stands proudly alongside winterbottom's other films . hopefully , neither the title nor the subject matter will deter viewers from experiencing this memorable motion picture .

"" the editing is even less subtle than the photography . during the prologue , we keep switching to the words in fair verona on a solid background to make sure we are not missing the points . there isn't a subtle moment in the movie . the music ( nellee hooper ) and the sound of the film are dramatic and impressive . the sounds , especially of the ever prevalent guns and hot cars , are loud and jolting . the acting by most of the cast is full of exaggerated gestures , but next to mercutio , the most outlandish is that diane venora as gloria capulet , paul sorvino as fulgencio capulet and miriam margolyes as the nurse . since it is just about to open , this is usually a bad sign and means the film is in trouble . i am not sure what the problem was . at any rate , baz luhrmann's romeo and juliet should be controversial and popular , the former to make even more of the latter . most shakespeare , even ian mckellen's vision of richard iii as a world war ii british fascist , is done seriously . here , the critics in the theater were laughing with the picture . baz luhrmann has turned a romantic tragedy into a farce and an extremely handsome looking farce at that . the downfall of the show has to be the acting . visuals like dave paris ( paul stephen rudd ) being on the cover of time as the most eligible bachelor in the land are funny , but most of the actors do little more than read their lines . the script by baz luhrmann and craig pearce is a very literal adaptation of shakespeare's text , but the director uses the images of the story and not the words to convey his message which is a shame . the acting by claire danes and leonardo dicaprio is good , but nothing special . they've all done better work . the rest of the cast is okay . the excitement of the film can be attributed to baz luhrmann and his previously mentioned crew . a director who places much of the balcony scene in and under the water of rich capulet's swimming pool is one not afraid to take risk . a wild picture by a bold director . romeo and juliet runs about 2 hours and my guess is that the film is rated r . they were lucky to have a screening much less get out a press kit . the film contains one drug use scene , bloody violence , but no bad language , sex or nudity . given that the much tamer zeffirelli film had brief and effective male and female nudity , i was surprised that this outre version didn't . the show should be fine for teenagers , who will probably love it . i found it great fun and give it a thumbs up . it is destined for cult classic status . although i rate it * * * , if you see it and hate it , don't say i didn't warn you that it was extremely bizarre and certainly not for everyone . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7
"if you didn't have enough of them two years ago , the addams family is back with a movie that does little more than rehash the same "" spirit "" and recycle the same jokes . a few sparkling performances and funny moments save this from being a waste of time , but it's not a promising way to start the thanksgiving/christmas movie season . much of what was valid about 1991's the addams family is true of this sequel . in fact , i could just about regurgitate the review for that film in this case . the movies are more than similar , although less than identical , and it's almost guaranteed that those who relished part one will enjoy part two ( unless they grow tired of hearing variations on the same one-liners ) . any movie that tries to be funny for an hour and a half is bound to score from time-to-time , and this is true for addams family values . there are laughs to be had along the way , but not enough to cover up the obvious lack of plot . this film is a series of cartoons loosely strung together , and too much of the humor is obvious . with a legitimate storyline , addams family values might have been great fun , but as it is , it's about twice as long as it needs to be . why is it that the most impressive thing about these tv-to-movie transformations seems to be the casting ? christopher lloyd may be a bit annoying as fester , but he gets the job done . joan cusack is wonderfully over-the-top as debbie the psycho nanny , with her primary functions being to snarl lines and expose cleavage . even two years older , the most notable cast member is still christina ricci , who turns in a beautifully deadpan performance as wednesday ( and even gets an opportunity to smile ) . there are times in this movie when she's the only thing worth watching , and she saves the "" wednesday and pugsley go to summer camp "" subplot from turning into an agonizing viewing experience . generally speaking , addams family values delivers what its viewers expect from it , and that makes it the simplest of films to review . i don't think it's worth a trip to the movies--there's not enough humor or inventiveness for that--but doubtless many will disagree . the box office tally will determine if there's to be a third installment . of course , it's still open to debate whether the second film was warranted in the first place .",0.52
"screenplay : kevin meyer and keith samples . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 95 minutes . a plot synopsis for a smile like yours reads like the most generic of bittersweet romantic comedies . sounds quite a bit like she's having a baby , doesn't it ? only it's more like she's _not_ having a baby , because a smile like yours is a bittersweet romantic comedy about infertility . that's right , all the wacky hijinks of masturbating into a cup ! all the side-splitting humor of spending an hour in stirrups ! i can understand the temptation to search for humor in a subject as frustrating , embarrassing and occasionally guilt-inducing as fertility problems . perhaps either writer/director keith samples or his co-writer kevin meyer had some personal experience in this area , and felt the need to share their quest for a smile amidst the tears . and it might have worked if they had bothered to include a single honest moment in a smile like yours . there is no attempt to understand how danny and jennifer really feel about their dilemma , no sense of any genuine pain . samples and meyer have merely grafted a few scenes at a fertility clinic onto a fluffy and absurdly predictable relationship comedy , forcing you to wonder why it couldn't just as easily have been about a couple struggling with financial problems , or an irritating relative , or the heartbreak of psoriasis . it's actually fairly impressive how generic and predictable a smile like yours turns out to be . the casting certainly doesn't help matters , offering the mundanely attractive kinnear and holly as our protagonists without once stepping inside their heads ( we never learn why jennifer is so underhanded about trying to get pregnant , considering danny seems perfectly comfortable with the idea ) . even the supporting cast -- jay thomas as the acerbic guy pal , joan cusack as the daffy gal pal -- appears to have been generated by a computer program . the film is so ennervated for so long that a late cameo by shirley maclaine provides virtually the entire energy quotient in three minutes of screen time . for an hour and a half a smile like yours trudges in the most obvious directions , reaching a grating climax in a scene where several agonizing seconds pass between the moment we _know_ jennifer is going to call danny's hotel room and find another woman there , and the moment the phone actually rings . infertility may be a delicate issue , but it's hardly sacrosanct . a competent film-making team might have made either an exaggerated black comedy or a more sensitive comedy-drama about the issue . it deserves much better than to become an afterthought in a story which has nothing creative or insightful to offer on any subject . you know you're in trouble when the biggest laugh in a film comes during a scene when a character is watching a rerun of "" i love lucy "" . . . and the laugh is actually _at_ the rerun of "" i love lucy .

"she didn't plan it that way -- you _can't_ plan it that way -- but pretty woman placed her in that rarefied stratum of film performers audiences will come to see on the strength of their names . for a couple of years , roberts tried to fight for her right to be a serious actress , taking less glamorous roles ( mary reilly ) or supporting roles ( michael collins , everyone says i love you ) for a-list directors , but the audience made its voice heard : "" we want our pretty woman back . "" in my best friend's wedding , roberts concedes to being a movie star once again . that premise sets the stage for some potentially outrageous comedy of the "" all's fair in love and war "" variety , but roberts never looks entirely comfortable with being outrageous . the interpretation of movie star-dom adopted by roberts , screenwriter ronald bass and director p . j . hogan ( muriel's wedding ) involves never being anything less than likeable , never doing anything which risks turning the audience against you . they don't understand that one of the perqs of being a movie star is that the audience is always ready to be on your side . it's no great revelation that there are only two possible outcomes in my best friend's wedding -- either julianne will triumph over an out-classed opponent , or she'll learn in important lesson and make a sacrifice . in either case , we're ready to be amused by her machinations before we get to that outcome ; we greet julianne's announcement that kimmy is "" toast "" with a chuckle of anticipation , not a sigh of disapproval . the reason my best friend's wedding isn't a better comedy , the reason it meanders but rarely soars , is that julianne's feeble efforts are about as likely to toast kimmy as a hot water bottle is to toast bread . bass's script is guided by the idea that julianne's hands should never get too dirty . roberts has some wonderful reaction shots in my best friend's wedding , but she reacts far more than she acts . in one of the film's most ironic lines , julianne apologizes to michael for all the "" awful and not even terribly imaginative things "" she has done . bass might have been better served coming up with more imaginative things rather than apologizing for the ones he came up with . surprisingly , my best friend's wedding is still fairly entertaining , thanks to a few unexpected bursts of irreverence . director hogan , who is turning into a prime candidate to direct a musical some day , continues his fascination with lip-synching to pop chestnuts , setting a slick opening credits sequence to "" wishin' and hopin' "" and turning a rehearsal dinner into an impromptu sing-along to "" i say a little prayer . "" the latter scene is a showcase for rupert everett , whose hilarious supporting work as george eliminates all fears of yet another "" gay friend "" character . his every moment on screen gives the film a jolt of comic energy , and proves that it is possible to be both devilish and thoroughly appealing . julia roberts could have learned a few things by studying his performance . if this is what she feared about movie star roles -- that they would require her merely to show up , smile and toss her hair -- she may have had good reason to be concerned . while my best friend's wedding is pretty amusing , roberts' return to being a pretty woman is pretty ordinary .",0.6
"date released : 1/27/95 ( wide ) running length : 1 : 43 rated : r ( language , violence , mature themes , brief nudity ) starring : sigourney weaver , ben kingsley , stuart wilson director : roman polanski producers : thom mount and josh kramer screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman based on the play by ariel dorfman cinematography : torino delli colli music : wojciech kilar released by fine line features this atmosphere , so carefully constructed by director roman polanski and cinematographer torino delli colli , is by far death and the maiden's most notable feature . in fact , a fair impression is that too much effort went into this aspect of the production , leaving little remaining for such minor details as plotting and acting . the premise , which also formed the backdrop for the ariel dorfman play upon which this film is based , is a solid one , brimming with potential for a great dramatic thriller--potential that is never realized in the film . the storyline is littered with contrivances . individually , each is acceptable , but combined , they give the film a bloated , overplotted feel . any degree of tension cultivated by polanski is frequently undermined by rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman's sputtering script . the central mystery is whether or not miranda is the vicious animal of paulina's memories . unfortunately , this question is answered far too early . supposedly , this is to allow the drama to swirl around the trio of characters--but there's a flaw in the approach . due in large part to lackluster acting , none of these people ever captures the audience's sympathy . we simply don't care one way or another about them . the house could explode and it wouldn't be worth more than a shrug . sigourney weaver is the worst of the small cast . her performance careens wildly from stilted to over-the-top with little transition in between . several of her most dramatic moments are unintentionally hilarious . at her best , the actress is marginal ; here , she's out of her depth . his character is supposed to be relatively impotent , but wilson plays the part almost mechanically . even the reliable ben kingsley isn't in top form ( although he's eminently more watchable than his co-stars ) . as was the case with bitter moon , polanski abandons all attempts at subtlety . the resulting production ends up far too heavy-handed to be considered powerful drama . perhaps the best lesson viewers of this movie will come away with is how dangerous it can be to pick up stranded motorists .",0.44
"and , judging from the actual journey , if author anne rice has any complaints about the shoddy treatment her book got in this limp translation , they're probably well-justified . exit to eden is really two stories in one , which is this case means less , not more , for the money . the film exhibits a split personality in just about every area , from its views on sex down to its uncertainty about whether it wants to be a slapstick crime farce or an offbeat romance . taken alone , this particular storyline might have made an enjoyable motion picture . if he didn't want to face up to certain serious issues , director garry marshall could have done something similar to what he did with pretty woman . unfortunately , this is only half the plot--and the better half by far . there are a lot of attempts at slapstick in exit to eden , none of which work . in motion pictures , there are few lamer things than jokes that fall flat , and this movie is full of them . despite the presence of accomplished comics o'donnell and aykroyd , exit to eden is almost laughless . worse still , all the failed humor detracts from time that might better have been spent developing the relationship between elliot and lisa . rather than approaching his potentially-controversial subject matter with a degree of sensitivity and intelligence , marshall elects to adopt a porky's-like , exploitative attitude . exit to eden has all the ingredients of late-night cable fare . the film , which invites a decidedly-unfavorable comparison to john duigan's sirens , isn't so much repugnant as it is disappointing . it's "" r "" rating also raises questions about the basic inconsistency of the mpaa . other , non-mainstream films have gotten "" nc-17 "" s for a lot less . perhaps the association tempered their rating because they found exit to eden amusing . if so , they're probably the only ones .",0.49

"if one were to applaud the effort . will pretentious crap do for a succinct review of the film ! it is more of a joke than a serious film , as all it tries to do is push the boundaries of technical innovation , while it neglects the basics of movie making : character development and the telling of a good story . shot on digital video in real time , with four hand-held cameras filming four different split screens , allowing the viewer to pick his poison as to which screen to watch , the narrative is told without any cuts , therefore no editor is needed . one of the screens has a louder volume , indicating that is the one the director thinks we might be more interested in watching . this soap opera story is about the lives and loves of sundry people connected to a hollywood production company , as they cast for their latest film project , which it turns out , is similar to the film just seen . well , at least , there should be something said about honesty in recognizing the worth of the product produced . the filmmaker's attempt here , is to make a stinging satire on hollywood and himself . timecode , under the pretense of being innovative , gets a big studio to take a chance on producing it , which doesn't mean it's worthwhile . the film was most like one of those stationary camcorder sites that they have on the internet , of say , some street corner , where the viewer hopes the time he spends is not wasted and something spontaneous will unfold to make it worth his while . at various times , the obvious symbolism of an earthquake is used as an artificial means to shake up all the characters in the quadrant . it was awkwardly done , seemingly ruining whatever natural effect was aimed for in telling this story in real time . i just couldn't get interested in this experimental film , finding it dizzying to watch and i was also hampered by its lack of wit and lack of spontaneous outrageousness . "" timecode "" just couldn't translate its sense of fun to the viewer , at least it couldn't to me . as for the technical feats attempted , maybe a more innovative filmmaker could make something of this format that wasn't done right here . other than that , this plays mostly as a novelty film , one to see because it's part of movie history .",0.4

"the film wavers between being a philosophical treatise on women and being about a woman's passions without resolving what any contemporary woman's magazine currently does ( this unresolvement can be seen in both a positive and a negative sense ) . the effort here is to push the film along shock value lines , of pushing it more into the lines of what a porno film does as routine . some of her revelations might surprise the opposite sex , as this film is helpful like a self-help book is meant to be . she makes no bones about it that she loves the carnal act . marie's best comment to this is , "" why do men who disgust us , understand us best . "" she seems to enjoy this perverse relationship , of being degraded , better than all her others , as we see her with robert in this situation twice . despite the film's coldness , lack of humor , bleak conceptions about relationships , unappetizing sexual scenes , lack of dramatic tension , and pretentious philosophizing by caroline ducey , it still had something disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to . for the director , sex is shown to be what fantasies are made of : that it is all in one's head . to show this , breillat her heroine be nude for many scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she has about sex , as we watch her act out these fantasies . though the film might not always be appealing , it is still not a work of trash ; it does have something to say of what goes on in the marital bedroom . how much you like what it says might depend on what you thought it was digging at and if its romantic notions rang a bell in your head . my thoughts are that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me , but afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about relationships , which are still just as great a mystery as god is , and i began to warm to the film more than while i was watching it . it , somehow , made me think more about the dark side of a relationship and for that reason alone , i wouldn't entirely dismiss this film , though i wonder at what it really was trying to get at . the body of the film's works is quite different than its ending , which shows ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being fulfilled . i think this is a film women might be more appreciative than men .",0.4
"in fiction films , we're used to getting an impartial take on "" reality ; "" this picture twists that principle . not everything presented in the usual suspects actually happens , and some things occur differently than shown . the opening sequence , which details the climax of the gang's capers , teases the audience about what may or may not be the ultimate resolution . director bryan singer , who debuted in 1993 with public access , has crafted another in the recent batch of '90s noir thrillers . the usual suspects is steeped in atmosphere , and borrows heavily from dozens of sources -- hitchcock , scorsese , the coen brothers , and just about every master of the genre , past or present . like quentin tarantino , singer's greatest strength is culling moments from other sources and using them in his own mold . there aren't many unique instances in the usual suspects , but the entire film is infused with a freshness that results from the manner in which singer has produced it . the energetic , serpentine plot provides the perfect playground in which a series of deliciously devious characters can have fun . the audience is only slowly let into the story -- at the beginning , everyone on-screen knows more than we do . this film requires that a viewer pay careful attention to details . those who get lost have only themselves to blame -- the usual suspects doesn't take any prisoners . the cast is solid , and several of the actors play against type . benicio del toro ( fearless ) provides most of the humor , much of which comes as a result of his nearly indecipherable accent . singer does an excellent job of blending humor into his noir thriller . there's enough to avoid a sense of ponderousness , but not so much that the usual suspects becomes campy . unlike many motion pictures , this one continually builds to its conclusion . as the usual suspects moves towards its inevitable finale , soze's shadowy presence becomes increasingly more ominous and important , and we get the sense that those who think they hold the cards actually have the weakest hands . in the way it folds its various elements into a single resolution ( which the astute viewer will be able to guess beforehand ) , singer's film can be accused of toying with the audience . however , at times like this , when the person tugging the strings is adept at his craft , being toyed with can be a worthwhile experience . the usual suspects is an accomplished synthesis of noir elements and , as such , is an entertaining entry to the genre .",0.84
"he proposes to call his first picture 20 dates because that is precisely how many women he promises to date in the movie . the movie is actually a mock documentary , but it was realistic enough to fool some of the critics at our press screening . the movie written and directed by and starring myles berkowitz , does not have the sharp writing of the wonderfully inventive waiting for guffman , another mock documentary . nevertheless , 20 dates is pure , unadulterated fun , and a perfect date movie . well , probably not a "" first "" date movie . as seems somehow appropriate , 20 dates uses movie romance as its benchmark for true love . even if myles ultimately concludes that "" love , real love , is like a really great movie , "" along the way he uses delightful clips from classic movies to poke fun at celluloid romance . he argues that real life isn't like the movies , which usually end with the man and the woman running toward each other for the big kiss , while the music comes up . like some expos ? on "" 60 minutes , "" we hear the backer scream obscenities about how he wants the movie done , which myles rejects for artistic reasons . while the backer speaks , we see the outside of some sleazy building as his words are shown below it in subtitles . myles likes to add cartoonish graphics for humor . as myles plods through his dates , we see graphics like checkmarks and question marks superimposed on the screen , representing his thinking on how each date is progressing . the best use of graphics occurs when he pokes fun at the waste of money in most motion pictures . although handsome and well dressed , except for his proclivity to mix red and green , myles manages to turn most dates off in subtle ways . these are the key questions in this breezy movie that goes down as easy as the ubiquitous wine that myles uses with little success to loosen up his prey . it is rated r for profanity and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers .",0.7
"cast : emily watson , stellan skarsgard , katrin cartlidge , jean-marc barr , adrian rawlins , udo kier director : lars von trier producers : vibeke windelov , peter aalbaek jensen screenplay : lars von trier cinematography : robby muller music : joachim holbek u . s . distributor : october films according to writer/director lars von trier , breaking the waves is "" a simple love story "" , but "" simple "" hardly begins to describe this deeply disturbing , multi-layered drama . in fact , nowhere is the picture's complexity more evident than in its study of contrasts -- it is highly spiritual yet anti-religious , triumphant yet tragic , and personal yet universal . love forms the film's core , but rather than approaching the subject from a cliched perspective , breaking the waves examines no less than six facets of the emotion : transformative love , sacrificial love , redemptive love , destructive love , romantic love , and sexual love . and , despite a slightly disappointing conclusion , this movie still rates among the best of the year . those whose familiarity with the director dates to that movie will find breaking the waves a surprising experience . gone are the artistic , stylized flairs that dominated zentropa . the nearly-antiseptic perspective has been replaced by something far more involved and intimate . it's easy to view the characters in zentropa from a detached vantage point ; a similar approach is impossible for breaking the waves . ( the exact year is irrelevant since there's a timeless quality to the material -- it could be taking place today if the music , clothing , and automobiles didn't argue for an earlier decade . ) sex isn't for pleasure ; it's for procreation . outsiders aren't welcome ; they're consigned to hell . but heartbreak looms ahead . for most of the movie , von trier keeps it ambiguous whether she is psychotic or truly involved in some kind of special communion with the almighty . does she really hear god's voice , or is she exhibiting signs of a split personality ? unfortunately , in a late scene , von trier tips the balance in favor of one interpretation , and this dilutes the film's overall impact . that said , there's little doubt that von trier is using breaking the waves as an opportunity to contrast the elders' rigid , unforgiving attitudes with bess' gentle , giving spirit . breaking the waves is presented as an excursion in cinema verite . von trier , in collaboration with cinematographer robby muller , uses a handheld camera throughout . in addition , in order to obtain a grainy image with muted colors , the film makers took the original widescreen print , transferred it to video , then brought it back to film . so , while there are times when breaking the waves may threaten to induce nausea ( especially to those who sit close to the screen ) , this style effectively creates a faux documentary environment that breaches invisible barriers and brings us into painfully close contact with the characters . each chapter has a title that's presented during a brief intermission from the action which features a richly-hued , painting-like image on screen while '70s rock tunes ( like elton john's "" goodbye yellow brick road "" or david bowie's "" life on mars "" ) play in the background . the biggest problem with these inserts is that , while they offer a brief respite from the film's unrelenting intensity , their interruption of the mood becomes an unwanted intrusion . the supporting players , including stellan skarsgard and katrin cartlidge , do fine jobs , but none captures the lens the way watson does . there's no denying that breaking the waves is a difficult motion picture to endure , yet , despite its length , it holds the viewer's attention for the full one-hundred fifty-nine minutes . excepting the chapter breaks , there isn't a wasted moment . and , if not for a somewhat forced catharsis during the epilogue ( the weakest segment of the movie ) , breaking the waves would have been more wrenching than it is . this achievement announces that von trier's aptitude for fashioning characters equals , if not exceeds , that which he has previously displayed for images .",0.85
"i saw changing habits at its world premier and was fortunate the next day to be granted a personal interview with its talented director , lynn roth . this review includes the highlights of the interview as well as some of the comments she made at the premier . since the movie has a well known cast and crew , i predict the picture will quickly be picked up by a distributor . although they are played believably , they are each quite funny . she doesn't speak because she doesn't feel any need . she does end up saying exactly one word in the show , and that scene is precious . the story is hard to categorize . this part is a quasi-romantic comedy . the movie is both enchanting and wise . if forced to categorize it , i guess i would label it a coming-of-age story , but it is so much more . the performances are all good with one exception . i thought christopher lloyd took too long to get into character . some shows are more than the some of its parts , and this is one . i attribute this to the talent of first-time director lynn roth . technically the show is highly polished . most of this can be attributed to the choice of an accomplished cinematographer , michael mayers . you may have admired his work in spanking the monkey and denise calls up . the only major problem i had with the movie was the surprising turn the show takes toward the end . i thought it was too abrupt and out of character for the rest of the film . i discussed this with the director . she told me she wanted this part isolated because she did not want the film to be too much of a downer . i found out more about the picture and roth's career . she said that the film was made over a period of just 20 long days . the producer , whose background is in casting , wanted dylan walsh to play felix , but he said no . she said that i looked old enough to have seen it , which i was , and i did . from there she had a series of positions in writing , producing , and sometimes acting . she likes theatrical movies best because it gives you a freedom that television does not . she did say that some of the cable channels , she mentioned a couple , are beginning to encourage directors without putting the limitations on them that networks normally do . i hope the distributors form a good habit by picking up her work quickly . in a strong film festival , this was one of the best . it is not yet rated but will probably get a pg-13 for a little bad language . the show would be fine for kids say 10 and up . i recommend the show to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 30 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7

"the film has its rewarding moments to counter its muddled attempt to cover what actually happened . but spike is not that concerned with the serial killer , his perspective of the event is how it influenced an italian bronx neighborhood , bringing out its paranoia . the most interesting character in the film is not david berkowitz , but vinny ( leguizamo ) from the bronx , a hairdresser , someone of a working-class mentality and someone who is possessed with a weak character . it was at times a film that bordered on greatness , but then for long stretches turned back into a mess , filled with untenable stereotypes of the italians , while losing track of its story about the psycho . . 44-caliber michael badalucco's characterization added nothing to the story except disappointment that his character wasn't even attempted to be explored . it's a messy film , moving in many different directions , but it is filled with ideas and is always engaging . the lead performers leguizamo , brody , esposito , sorvino , and rispoli give crisp performances . leguizamo's performance is special in a visceral way , it exposes his double-standard life and his lowlife mindset , his rage is what the film keys in on . the film doesn't really come to a climax or say anything new about society at large , but it has an excitement of its own that is grandiose . that's about as complimentary as i can get about a film that should be praised more than it should be lambasted for its faults . it should be praised for showing how scared people are of those who are different and how they need to blame someone for what they don't understand . the scene near the end of the film was particularly violent and revolting , giving the film the jolt it needed to make its case about those who are narrow minded . this was not a film , after all , about the killer , its victims , or about the summer of 1977 , it was a film about those who were victimized because they are made into scapegoats for someone else's problems that they can't face themselves . it is a film about urban white people of italian origin : their fears , their angers , their prejudices , their repressions , and their eroticisms . it almost seems as if the story about the son of sam was not even needed . this was a film almost exclusively about an italian neighborhood and their xenophobia , and it could have taking place in any year after 1950 .",0.5

"" assuming the question isn't rhetorical , i'd like to pose one : exactly why is this film called shaft , anyway ? the original 1971 "" blaxploitation "" film may look rough and ridiculously dated to contemporary eyes -- it's hard to take seriously any film in which the word "" whitey "" plays such a prominent role -- but it was a fairly revolutionary portrayal of an african-american anti-hero as tough , sexual and beholden to absolutely no one . the presence of isaac hayes' famous theme song may tell you this is shaft , but is this story the one described in those famous lyrics ? the 1971 original was an audacious film in its low-budget way , including a scene in which shaft ( roundtree ) has sex with a white woman . it's depressing to realize that mainstream hollywood continues to be as timid as it ever was in portraying the sexuality of black men . aside from a stylized montage over the opening credits , jackson's shaft is practically asexual . there's plenty of danger all about in shaft , with two extremely effective villains . some viewers may find his performance the most outrageous latino crime boss parody since pacino tore up his cuban accent in scarface . i found something compelling and creepy about peoples , from his manic self-mutilation to his casual con artistry . between the two of them , bale and wright could have been the anchors of a better-than-average cop thriller , one that didn't have a title immediately creating a different set of expectations . no question , samuel l . jackson can be a bad mutha . in fact , there's so much emphasis on making him tough in a mad-as-hell way that jackson never captures shaft's toughness in an i-don't-have-anything-to- prove-to-anyone way . throughout the film , it becomes ever more clear that singleton has either misunderstood what made john shaft such an important screen character or found himself unable to convey that same essence . he also found himself unable to build a story that means anything , resorting to a climax that may be intended as a triumph over the system but ultimately renders the previous 90 minutes of action utterly pointless . i can't deny that i might have felt much more positively about shaft if it hadn't set itself up for comparison to an iconic film . there are some solidly entertaining moments here , perhaps enough to satisfy viewers with little or no awareness of the history behind the title . but there's that title before the film , a title that just feels wrong for what follows it on the screen . they're just not talkin' about shaft . and i can't dig it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"the epsteins are wonderful musicians and storytellers , openly explaining their music and talking about themselves with no pretensions or false modesty . they have no inhibitions about talking , in fact , it is hard to get them to keep quiet . but the richness of the lively music and the very natural and easy way the brothers play and communicate , makes this a heartfelt film , just like the music being played . you don't have to be jewish to like the music , as they proved to be popular in front of a mainly non-jewish audience in berlin , who couldn't get enough of that music . but when they played in their florida neighborhood to an elderly jewish audience , you couldn't help but notice how much more lively and even more appreciative their audience was . it also goes on a dull side trip to pinsk , a place that borders russia-poland , where their parents are from , but someplace they are unfamiliar with and because of that there was nothing worthwhile to see there . but , in all fairness to the director , aside from a few lapses in the film , he did capture the essence of the kletzmer music and what makes the epsteins so special . the brothers take pride in their craft and it shows in their musical pieces presented , as they bring out a heartfelt joy in their music . it was a fun film to watch , and it was informative to watch them practice and discuss the music , never taking themselves too seriously , but always serious about doing a good job . this film should be seen for the remakable music , the film itself is not that remarkable .",0.6
"this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) . the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence . the essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or not , though it would help if you would not be entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a life-after-death . fleur , still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed , appears out of place in this modern capitalistic society , that has forgotten not only its ancient roots but its recent past . this film fascinated me on many levels , but mainly , it made me wonder about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved . it allows us the opportunity to ask ourselves , if we can really believe in spiritual things without being spiritual ? is there something worth dying for ? this is truly one of the best films to come out of hong kong in the modern era . even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone .",0.8

"the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments . the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life . at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . this awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .",0.7
"the adventures of felix ( dr ? le de f ? lix ) , jointly written and directed by olivier ducastel and jacques martineau , is a gay romance and road trip that never amounts to much of anything . although handsomely filmed by matthieu poirot-delpech , the picture is about as memorable as a nondescript television soap opera , which is something that the lead character , f ? lix ( sami bouajila , the siege ) , dotes upon . much of f ? lix's life consists of popping pills ( he's hiv positive , something the film doesn't dwell on ) , guzzling bottled water and watching his favorite morning soap opera . he seems to like his life , but it doesn't make for a particularly compelling narrative . better return the baby -- but not the car -- to the baby's screaming mother . if there is an audience for this slice-of-life story , it might be as an erotic tale for gay men . f ? lix is a handsome guy , and there is a lot of open mouth kissing and passionate embraces shown in the movie . personally , i found only one section cute . it's a wacky moment that recalls abbott and costello's famous "" who is on first ?

"ever since pulp fiction blazed its way into the spotlight in 1994 , countless films have attempted to re-capture the heady mix of violence , snappy dialogue , and dark comedy that quentin tarantino tapped into . thus far , it has proven to be a difficult brew to distill , as countless lackluster attempts have proven . suicide kings , from first-time feature director peter o'fallon , is one of the few motion pictures to come close . and , while the narrative is a little too erratic to ascend to the pulp fiction level , the tone and style are on target . for those who aren't offended by extreme profanity and violence , suicide kings offers a kinetic and surprisingly funny two hours . but times change , and charlie has gone legit . if you can get past some of the film's basic setup implausibilities , suicide kings is a lot of fun . it's more of a dark comedy than anything else , and several scenes are borderline-hilarious . the film is somewhat less successful in its attempt to develop a mystery ( which of charlie's captors , if any , is in on lisa's kidnapping ? ) -- there are a few unnecessary red herrings and at least one plot twist too many . nevertheless , this is just one facet of a clever and involving storyline , and the real meat of the movie is the verbal chess match between charlie and the others , who treat him with mixture of fear and awe . the dialogue is well-written and director o'fallon brings an element of tension to the quirky atmosphere . with all of the guns , knives , needles , and frayed nerves , it's difficult to guess what's going to happen next . i also enjoyed the subplot featuring denis leary , who plays the most tarantino-esque character in the film , a hitman who wears $1500 shoes and offers a homeless person $500 to better himself . his interaction with his sidekick is reminiscent of the travolta/jackson exchanges in pulp fiction , only here the subject matter is shoes , not burgers . given his track record , it should come as no surprise that walken steals the movie . while the role of charlie isn't new territory for the veteran actor , there are a few twists , since he's essentially the "" good guy "" here ( at least in as much as an ex-mobster can be a "" good guy "" ) . in one of his most impressive outings in recent years , walken never goes over the top -- for him , this is a subdued portrayal , but it's fully of dry , self-deprecating wit and subtle menace . the other bravura performance belongs to denis leary , who was born to play a part like this with this sort of clipped , rapid-fire dialogue . it suits him perfectly , and , while vecchio is far from a well-developed character , he's always a pleasure to watch . the actors playing the young captors are less charismatic , and their characters are not as interesting . it isn't a perfect motion picture , but there's enough here to earn an enthusiastic recommendation for those who enjoy this genre . while the approach isn't new , the style is invigorating and the storyline boasts at least a few original ideas . the result is a deliciously demented comedy/thriller that will leave tarantino fans applauding .

"screenplay : richard price . director : barbet schroeder . to answer the most obvious question first : no , david caruso's naked posterior does not appear in kiss of death , although it might have been appropriate . caruso's first opportunity for an "" i told you so "" comes in kiss of death , but he might be advised to postpone any self- congratulation . in a film that is erratic but frequently intense , his casting in the lead role is the most glaring flaw . the screenplay for kiss of death , written by richard price based on a 1947 film noir of the same name , is a dense piece of plotting , but an extremely confident one . like a novel , kiss of death unfolds in well-developed pieces , building towards a solid conclusion with very little extraneous material . the plot's twists are both relevant and unexpected , and director barbet schroeder keeps a steady hand on the pace . yet somehow , in the middle of all the clockwork plotting , gaping flaws in logic and flat-out sloppiness appear . then , near the end of the film , one of the big payoff revelations is spoiled by an unnecessary establishing shot . it sometimes seems that schroeder is so busy painting the trim on the house that is kiss of death that he fails to notice it's missing a wall . it's a good thing that so many of the people in that house are so interesting . he is mis-used in the conclusion for a gimmicky applause moment , but otherwise turns in stellar work . add stanley tucci's duplicitous d . a . and helen hunt as jimmy's recovering alcoholic wife , and you have one of the best supporting casts since pulp fiction . unlike pulp fiction , however , the lead performances are not of the same caliber . nicolas cage is an actor who has shown the ability to play everything from romantic leads to villains , but there is no center to little junior . as for caruso , he is given a role that would be a challenge to make sympathetic by an actor with much greater range . caruso is unable to give jimmy any humanity , delivering every line in the same hushed , primed-to-explode manner . only he never does explode , and it is particularly telling that jimmy's one big emotional outburst occurs behind a closed door . we need to see jimmy as a charater reacting to what is happening to him , but by playing him with an omnipresent hangdog resignation , caruso might have been the kiss of death for a potentially engrossing thriller .",0.6

"it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it .",0.5
"the crown jewel of 1995's summer blockbusters appears to have arrived early . it's hard to imagine any motion picture released between now and august matching mel gibson's braveheart for spectacle . with its clashing armies , heartstopping action , and grand sense of romance , this is the sort of film it's a pleasure to see and review . let me state my preferences up front . i'm a big fan of the epic adventure , a category in which braveheart , like cream , rises to the top . there's a lot in this film that's praiseworthy--not the least of which is its ambition . those viewing this picture may be easily reminded of gettysburg , the last of the mohicans , glory , and such classics as lawrence of arabia , el cid , and spartacus . the grandeur is certainly present ; nevertheless , gibson gives us not only memorable battles , but characters of real substance . borrowing from masters like sam peckinpah and david lean , the actor/director has crafted an exceptional cinematic tapestry in only his sophomore effort . most of the time , three hour movies have a few flat spots , but braveheart is constantly on the move--riveting from start to finish . when the end credits began to roll , i was hard pressed to accept that nearly 170 minutes had elapsed . the title character is william wallace ( gibson ) , a hero of scottish history whose legend has surely outstripped fact ( in its own unique way , the film acknowledges this ) . braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax . their courtship is unhurried , yet this is all preparation . patrick henry once said , "" give me liberty , or give me death ! "" that might well be wallace's motto . "" it's all for nothing if you don't have freedom ! "" bulked up and wearing a long-haired wig , gibson brings his usual wealth of charisma to the title role . his edward the longshanks exudes an aura of cold menace . he's a worthy foe for wallace because his intelligence matches his ruthlessness . sophie marceau , the french actress who plays princess isabelle , and catherine mccormack are both immensely appealing . braveheart is a brutal , bloody motion picture , but the violence is not gratuitous . the maimings , decapitations , and other assorted gruesome details make wallace's world seem real and immediate . in addition , few theatrical moments make a more eloquent statement against war than when gibson shows women and children weeping over the dead on a body-littered battlefield . war is a two-headed beast , and both faces--the glorious and the tragic--are depicted . lately , certain films have come in pairs : two robin hoods , two columbuses , two earps , and now two highlander epics . rob roy , the first , is a fine motion picture . braveheart , however , is better , offering an exhilarating , and occasionally touching , experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder . these days , heros like william wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high , uncompromising quality .",0.93
"of all the different kinds of movies , love stories are likely to provoke the widest variety of reaction , since personal preference is such a crucial element in evaluating these films . it's far easier to agree on what constitutes a solid drama or enjoyable comedy than an effective romance . scenes which melt some hearts will churn the stomachs of others . a walk in the clouds , director alfonso arau's followup to like water for chocolate , is such a picture . there are moments when this movie is absolutely magical , but the ending lays it on much too thick . for more than an hour , a walk in the clouds is thoroughly enchanting . with spectacular visuals and a script laced with little romantic touches , the first seventy-five minutes weave a spell that will dissipate the cynicism of even the grumpiest viewer . but then the melodrama , which is initially light and innocuous , asserts its presence and draws the film into a ponderously silly climax . even the most beautifully-realized love story can't camouflage this kind of flaw . the match which seemed so right when it happened turns out to be a horrible mistake . with this , his first big-budget , english language picture , arau outlines a classic case of cultural and generational conflict . somehow , however , a similar message came across more clearly in sandra bullock's while you were sleeping . newcomer aitana sanchez-gijon has a luminance that lights up the screen . as for reeves , he admittedly does a more credible job here than in most of his other work , but , for the most part , that's barely adequate . as was true of like water for chocolate , a walk in the clouds has an ethereal feel . shots of the vineyard , enhanced by post-production visual effects , are breathtaking . it is sensual , erotic , and joyous . the most disconcerting thing about a walk in the clouds' tendency towards overt melodrama is that almost all of it is totally unnecessary . minor script changes could have eliminated huge chunks of this , leaving behind an uplifting love story . even as it is , however , there's still something special about the motion picture . i just wish the final half- hour hadn't been such a bloated disappointment .",0.66

"but why are the entertainers all so sad ? with the film , spielberg boldly comes out foursquare against slavery -- not a very controversial or original idea . although spielberg devises many powerful scenes for the movie , his staging confuses more often than it enlightens . told by a host of known actors , almost all white , the overly long movie never takes the time to develop more than the one slave -- joseph cinque ( djimon hounsou ) -- into a real character . in rosewood , a much better film from earlier this year , we heard from a wide variety of african-americans , which made their plight real and vivid . how effective would shindler's list have been if only the nazis and the allies got parts , but the jews were relegated to a single character ? several groups sue for ownership of the slaves , but the script never takes the time to explore the issues as effectively as it should . instead , we get a cliff's notes-style outline of the case plus a few random scenes of the trials . when spielberg should be storytelling , too often we get theatrics instead . rather than anyone trying to repress the outbursts of the prisoner , everyone stares in awe at him as the music contains something approaching the sounds of the mormon tabernacle choir raising a loud voice to heaven . freeman gets little dialog and is basically wasted in the movie . but then , most of the characters in the film exist mainly in caricature . the best performance in the picture , and the only one with any depth , is given by anthony hopkins as the semi-senile , ex-president john quincy adams . even given the film's ponderous pacing , the slaves' story does come out . spielberg should have listened . all in all , amistad is an excellent story , poorly told . it is rated r for gore , nudity and mature themes , and would be fine for teenagers who can handle gruesome images .",0.6

"the songs are '50s style hits that have shown their enduring popularity . many fans of movie musicals recall grease with fondness . it certainly isn't a momentous film , and stands a considerable distance downslope from the pinnacle its genre , but it became a huge hit in an era when the musical was well into its death throes . aside from the likes of little shop of horrors ( 1986 ) , the disney animated films , and evita ( 1996 ) , there have been few memorable , big-budget motion picture musicals since grease . the film was also popular enough to spawn a sequel , catchily titled grease 2 , but the less said about that sad endeavor , the better . no one thinks grease's 1998 box office total will come close to that of the first installment of george lucas' space opera , but it should still make a tidy profit . the digitally-remastered soundtrack ( which sounds great ) and the enhanced color can only help . grease boasts what all successful motion picture musicals have : likable stars , a simple but not trivial plot , and a lot of enjoyable music . familiarity with the soundtrack is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the film's popularity ? several of the songs have achieved pop hit status . who can't recognize "" grease , "" "" hopelessly devoted to you , "" "" you're the one that i want , "" "" greased lightning , "" and "" summer nights "" ? these may not represent great music , but they're a lot of fun to listen to , as their abiding appeal proves . their eventual reunion , however , is anything but joyous . to sandy , the reaction is like a slap in the face . in addition to the songs , highlights of grease include travolta's daffy , limber performance as danny , newton-john's sexy-but-sweet sandy , and a cast of adults trying vainly to pass themselves off as high- schoolers . despite all of the silliness and singing , the exuberance of youth lies at the core of grease , and , although everything is greatly exaggerated here , the film brings back memories of what it was like to hang out in the school yard , take a date to a drive-in movie , and attend a prom . alternately swaggering to prove his "" coolness "" and re-affirming his ability on the dance floor , the actor gives the kind of performance that's perfect for the role . meanwhile , newton-john is equally solid , even though , at the time , she was far better known for making records than movies . sandy's transformation from shy wallflower to leather-clad babe is one of the film's best-remembered moments . the supporting cast contains a number of familiar faces . grease works as a musical , a comedy , a light romance , and a gentle satire of teenage life during the '50s . in part because of its persistent high spirits , it's a delight to watch , even 20 years after it first appeared on the screen . there's no doubt that grease has a devoted legion of fans , so it will be interesting to see how well the movie performs at the box office . after all , it is readily available on video tape , and , unlike last year's big re-release , there are no restored outtakes and enhanced special effects . the only things grease has to rely upon are its reputation and its music . for me , at least , that's enough for a trip to the theater .

"eventually , gresham becomes seriously ill and the movie becomes a terms of endearment ii . there are so many things special about this movie it is hard to know where to begin so let me take a little bit different approach and list them in order with the best first : script many lines poignant , funny , or both . wish i could have written all them down . in one example , winger describes hopkins and her as "" lapsed atheists "" . it has an excellent ending . the script by william nicholson deserves to win an oscar . i believe this was taken from a play . if so , you should get the play and read it . use your yellow marker to highlight the memorable lines . make sure your marker has plenty of ink before you start . finally , not only was the script excellent , the story itself was a fascinating love story . direction richard attenborough had a clear sense of what he wanted to do . and did it . very moving . acting hopkins was absolutely wonderful . okay , the character had similarities to the one in remains of the day in how reserved he was , but these were different roles . he deserves an oscar nomination for shadowlands . winger played a harsh , honest , strong , complex and yet vulnerable character . her acting range is enormous . excellent performance also worthy of an oscar nomination . actually , the only fault i have with the movie was that winger had trouble staying with her accent . cinematography the cinematography by roger pratt was beautiful and yet not overdone . made you want to go to oxford without overpowering the story and turning it into a travelogue . shadowlands runs 2 : 11 , and i think the editor ( lesley walker ) made just the right choices . if it had been shorter , we might have missed some aspect of two intriguing lives . it is rated pg only for the seriousness of its themes . it would be a great show for anyone old enough to contemplate serious illness . i strongly recommend this to you and award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : february 7 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.8

"monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist . we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . when they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up , it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life . even with all their bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here .",0.5
"screenplay : jeb stuart and philip morton . director : felix enriquez alcala . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . in an uncertain world , there's something strangely reassuring about the films of steven seagal . the economy may rise and fall , but seagal will always dispatch all adversaries with the same vaguely bored smirk and without a hair in his ponytail drifting out of place . you can't depend on political institutions , but you can depend on the fact that seagal will put together a wardrobe where nary a pastel nor a t-shirt will be found . all else changes , but seagal stays the same -- the same facial expression , the same tone of voice for every emotion , the same humorless self-importance . he is stasis personified . there's not much new to say about fire down below , because there's not much new to see . and none of those bones ever belong to seagal's character . a seagal fight sequence is uniquely monotonous not just because the hero always wins -- action heroes usually win -- but because no one ever lays a finger on him . i doubt seagal will ever make a truly thrilling action thriller ( and yes , that includes under siege ) because his ego could never permit any doubt as to the outcome ; his action scenes are like harlem globetrotters games without the showmanship . it's that ego of his which makes so many seagal films so wonderfully , terribly predictable . when he stops fire down below dead in its tracks to give a mini-version of his on deadly ground speech on environmental responsibility , you know it's because he genuinely believes someone cares what he thinks on the subject . -- you know it's because he's not about to take orders . and when he tries to work up some sensitive romantic chemistry with marg helgenberger , you want to laugh out loud at the idea that he could love anyone as much as he loves himself . sure , you can always count on a few token surprises , most of them completely ridiculous . there's a needless and unpleasant subplot about incestuous siblings -- nothing like dismantling appalachian stereotypes -- and a few colorful bursts of conveniently fluorescent toxic goop . mostly , however , there's more of the same fight-chase-explosion narrative structure and automoton emoting which makes the latest steven seagal film a natural sequel to the last steven seagal film . there's nothing remotely entertaining about fire down below , but there's something steadying about seagal's artistic intransigence . in turbulent times , you can almost take comfort in the knowledge that one man's name is as good as a plot description . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.2
"starring : steven seagal , michael caine , joan chen , john c . mcginley . screenplay : ed horowitz & robin u . russin . director : steven seagal . many filmmakers need someone to be the voice of reason , and that someone is usually the producer . the need can be even greater when the filmmaker in question is a rookie director , which brings us to the first law's first corollary : be especially wary when the name appearing three times before the title is seagal . on deadly ground marks action icon steven seagal's first time in the director's chair , and it looks like it . self-indulgent and deadly dull for at least half of its running time , on deadly ground demonstrates why an ego like seagal's needs something to keep it in check . for those of you who didn't believe steven seagal could do anything more ineptly than he acts , here's evidence to the contrary . he appears to have learned nothing about pacing and exposition from his two collaborations with andrew davis , turning in an action film painfully short on action . the first hour is devoted to an overlong set-up , briefly interrupted by a barroom brawl so badly edited in places that they had to dub in exclamations so that it would be clear exactly where forrest is kicking his victims . we are subjected to a handful of soapbox speeches about environmental degradation , including one in the middle of a thoroughly pointless dream/vision sequence . however , almost none of it is inspired until forrest reaches aegis 1 , and almost invariably the editing is attrocious . lots of things blow up in on deadly ground , but there is a "" so what "" quality to the pyrotechnics . still , seagal at least could have had the sense to end the film with a bang , instead of with a five minute monologue about the horrors of oil companies which rivals kevin costner's jfk skreed for dramatic ineptitude . it isn't even the point that he may be right ; he's just chosen the wrong forum . of course , the ultimate problem with any steven seagal project is that it must inevitably star steven seagal . where schwarzenegger entertains with his comic book persona and one-liners , and stallone brings an underdog quality to his action flicks , seagal's squinting stoic is just boring . under siege at least had a chance thanks to tommy lee jones' lively villain , but michael caine is not in that league , playing a nasty businessman we've seen a hundred times before . john c . mcginley puts a nice spin on the enforcer role , daring to lose his cool and admit he's no match for the hero . if directing on deadly ground is seagal's idea of stretching himself , i'd offer the words of laurence olivier as advice : "" just * act * , dear boy ; it's much easier .

"it's a fairly well-known fact that the indian film industry is the most active in the world , producing more movies each year than any other ( including hollywood ) . few of those films , however , reach screens beyond their domestic market . largely because of their limited north american appeal and dubious quality , indian movies are routinely ignored by distributors . there are exceptions , of course -- the work of satyajit ray and last year's bandit queen , for example . occasionally , however , a worthwhile picture causes enough people to take notice that it becomes a favorite on the international film festival circuit . one such movie is bombay , the fourteenth feature from celebrated director mani rathnam . in many ways , bombay is deceptive , but the manner in which it deceives the audience adds to its eventual impact . for the first hour , it's a relatively-lighthearted romantic musical . but shekhar and bano's love will not be denied . rehman , set the film's initial tone , which is one of soaring joy and passion . and , while the music isn't exactly of the toe-tapping variety , it's stronger and more memorable than most songs in american movies over the past year or two . just when you're starting to feel comfortable with bombay , everything changes -- and the unexpected shift in tone hits like a punch to the gut . gone is the fun and frivolity , as death and violence suddenly fill up the screen . now we understand the full extent of rothnam's purpose in the first half -- he was setting us up to like these characters so that when tragedy strikes , we can feel the pain and hopelessness of their situation . it's melodramatic and manipulative , to be sure , but it works . bombay's second half takes place during this time period . cinematographer rajiv menon captures the chaos of the riots . it's grim and terrifying , and , at times , difficult to watch . bombay is a gripping indictment of racial hatred . shekhar's cry that "" we are all indians first of all ! "" isn't heeded . the only response is echoed many times over : "" the divide will never heal . "" bombay ends on a hopeful note , but not before etching a series of wrenching images in the minds of viewers . bombay recalls how forceful a motion picture can be . it also reminds us of the maxim that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it . hopefully , some day , humankind will understand the lesson that rathnam is teaching here .",0.85

"one has to wonder why the film makers bothered to make a sequel to 1994's the crow . although it made money , that movie , which brought the world of james o'barr's comic book to life , was not a huge box office success , and a fair number of its viewers were probably lured into theaters by macabre curiosity . as a result , the release of the crow was swathed in the kind of lurid sensationalism that inevitably fattens up a gross . there is no such behind-the-scenes story to increase audiences for the second installment , and the result is likely to be a short theatrical life . everyone in the cast , from perez down , plays their role as if they are stoned . despite looking like an outcast from the band kiss , perez never musters much energy . mia kirshner , last seen stripping in exotica , gives a flat , uninteresting performance , and richard brooks' sadistic judah is more likely to inspire apathy than hatred . villains need to be charismatic ; brooks is just plain dull . iggy pop , who goes over-the-top as judah's sidekick , is much more entertaining . the start-to-finish violence and throbbing rock soundtrack are evidence that the film makers recognized the story's inadequacies and attempted to compensate on a purely visceral level . like the first crow , this is a new wave death wish , but that film at least had the distinction of being original in approach , if not content . this one is a rehash , and director tim pope doesn't display nearly the same skill that alex proyas brought to the earlier feature . really , though , when it comes to the crow 2 , the victims aren't the poor souls suffering on-screen -- they're the men and women who paid money to gain admittance to the theater . the crow , unlike the main character , should have stayed dead and buried after its first go-'round .",0.4

"fantasies that the whole family can enjoy are few and far between . studios executives generally look for kids' shows with minimum intelligence and maximum slapstick humor . the result is that these films are either major silly in an attempt to play down to the little tykes or they are full of gross bathroom humor thinking that is the only type that will keep the attention of the teens and subteens . it is a delight for all ages , and miracle of miracles , it does this without any crude jokes or anything offensive . he rationalizes that new zealand is far away , to which she grumbles , "" that's a lame excuse .

"" director carroll ballard ( the black stallion and never cry wolf ) has an imaginative and deft touch . why ballard has only made five films in seventeen years is a mystery to me . i do have two quibbles with the movie . first , why do we have the scene where the uncle gives amy a nose ring which she then wears for the rest of the picture . if this was a film about generation xers , i would understand , but this little fourteen year old is the epitome of sweetness and innocence . the nose ring is just out of character . second , why did we need the cliched subplot where the environmentalists are shown confronting evil capitalists , or is that an oxymoron in movies , who are raping nature . kids' movies uniformly show environment issues as totally one sided . that these kids live in houses made of lumber , drive cars powered by gasoline , and generally do lots of things where environmental tradeoffs are made every day is never discussed . just mention the word environment and you have trumped any possible argument . it is rated pg for three mild cuss words and a very subtlety handled car crash . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . the film would be fine for kids of absolutely any age , but should delight adults as well . i loved the show and think you will too so i recommend it and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.7

"in the hands of henry selick , who directed nightmare , this weird story has been transformed into a playful , visually arresting experience with more than a few allusions to the wizard of oz . obviously , the primary reason to see james and the giant peach is for its visual splendor . selick's stop-motion animation is , in its own way , as impressive as the technological marvels of toy story . james' creatures , which include insects , skeletons , birds , and a large-headed boy , are wonderfully exaggerated , but never grotesque . the live-action sequences , which comprise over one-third of the running length , are filmed on intentionally-overstated sets that contribute to a surreal atmosphere not unlike the one visited by jeunet and caro in delicatessan and the city of lost children . only when real actors and animated characters interact does the visual chicanery slip up . of course , all but the youngest children ( who could be frightened by certain scenes ) will be delighted by the film , and , as was true of nightmare , the script is written to succeed on more than one level . there are some deliciously wicked lines that few youngsters will get . this crisp dialogue is delivered by the likes of susan sarandon ( the spider ) , simon callow ( the grasshopper ) , david thewlis ( the earthworm ) , and richard dreyfuss ( the centipede ) , actors with effective vocal presences . unfortunately , the film makers have decided to include several completely forgettable musical numbers penned by randy newman . not only are these totally superfluous , but there are times when they hurt the film's pacing . i'd like to know who made the decision that every disney animated film , no matter who's doing the animation , has to have a share of songs . in the final analysis , james and the giant peach is undemanding entertainment with a subtle message . while the film isn't quite as accomplished as a toy story or a beauty and the beast , it's still worth a trip to the theater , especially for those who enjoy things that are a little unconventional .",0.75

"screenplay : nancy meyers and charles shyer . director : charles shyer . if you're making a list of movie terms you don't hear all that often , "" caper "" has to be right up there . i love trouble is an attempt to resurrect the caper , and you've got to hand it to nancy meyers and charles shyer for trying . they've put two appealing stars with great chemistry in a fast-paced film . they just forgot to give them anything to do . as much as i found myself wanting to enjoy i love trouble , it barely managed to divert me . the problem is that that characterization vanishes after the first fifteen minutes ( easily the film's best fifteen minutes ) . nolte and roberts struggle admirably to generate some kind of life for their characters , but all they can do is flash their thousand watt smiles and hope for the best . and they go farther than they have any right to , purely on the strength of their charm . when they smiled , i frequently smiled right along with them . it sort of makes you wonder what they could have done with a remotely interesting story . the big conspiracy at i love trouble's center is . . . unique , to say the least , but it's fairly tedious stuff . the identity of the villain is apparent from minute one , and i love trouble takes far too long to get into its main plot . in fact , i might go so far as to say that the plot never gets going , nor is it designed to . only there isn't any witty banter . all told , i have to wonder exactly what it is that meyers and shyer did to earn their screenwriting paychecks . their dialogue earns chuckles at best , their sense of pacing is extremely suspect , and their characterizations are wooden . like their baby boom and father of the bride , i love trouble seems designed only to move along affably , without spark or inventiveness of any kind . the fact is , there is nothing truly off-putting about i love trouble . nolte and roberts make an appealing tandem , and roberts' performance in particular is extremely energetic , perhaps her best work to date . but since a movie like i love trouble is inevitable in its outcome--the two reporters * will * end up together--getting there has to be more interesting . without any excitement in the suspense storyline , and with two bland characters contributing to a singularly vanilla romance , i was left watching two beautiful people be beautiful . it just wasn't enough .",0.4
"date released : 9/3/93 running length : 1 : 42 rated : r ( nudity , sexual situations , language , mature themes ) helena , however , feels nothing but disdain for nick , and shows it at every possible opportunity . those who expected a nice , normal film from the offspring of actor/director david lynch are in for a big shock . jennifer chambers lynch has borrowed a lot of her father's technique and style , and mr . lynch's own response to the film is that he ( not surprisingly ) "" really liked it . "" boxing helena is far from the beaten track , covering subjects guaranteed to scare away major hollywood studios and big-name stars . suspension of disbelief is crucial to boxing helena's success ( and the most probable reason it fails for those who dislike it ) . so much of what happens during the course of the film is impossible to accept given the logical confines of the real world , so for those unable to slip into the mood of the movie and naively accept the often-absurd intentions of the film makers , boxing helena will be a huge disappointment--a mix of gigantic contrivances and impossibilities of ludicrous proportions . of course , if one assumes that ms . lynch is going for dark comedy , that changes the viewer's entire perspective of the picture , shedding a new and warped light on some of what is supposed to be serious ( my own contention is that most--but not all--of the humor is unintentional ) . once it gets beyond a hard-to-swallow setup and into the meat of its story , boxing helena is surprisingly involving and intelligent--especially considering how fingernail sketches of the plot paint the movie . the script is certainly not concerned about the reality of circumstances and the actions of characters , focusing exclusively on the weird and unusual relationship the develops between sand's nick and fenn's helena , the inevitable captive/captor emotional bond . the movie discloses its terms early , and expects the audience to buy into them , making no apologies for what it is or intends to be . there are powerful moments in boxing helena , most resulting from the interaction between characters . neither of the primary parts is three-dimensional , but a fair amount of character development occurs during the course of the movie . one of the things that works against boxing helena is the performance of its lead actor . while julian sands doesn't precisely do a bad job , he rejects subtlety in favor of overstatement . while not an over-the-top performance ( take a look at what bill paxton does for one of those ) , neither is it an example of studied , careful acting . too often , ms . lynch's direction mirrors the job done by sands . there are a number of scenes that are handled in a rather heavy-handed way , with a little too much meaningless symbolism thrown in for good measure . fortunately , sands' opposite , sherilyn fenn , is superlative , giving an entirely credible performance as she turns a one-dimensional part into a vibrant character . it must be difficult to portray a limbless puppet , but ms . fenn never falters , making us forever grateful that the lackluster kim bassinger backed out . admittedly , ms . fenn looks a little too good for someone who had gone through helena's trauma , but that's another area where suspension of disbelief comes into play . the prosthetics of the amputations are never shown , and ms . fenn's own limbs are hidden through simple trickery , so there's no real need to comment on "" special effects "" . they are , in this case , no more or less than are necessary to tell the story . although helena's armless , legless impotence might be somewhat macabre , it isn't presented distastefully , resulting in a production that's more erotic than misogynistic . a series of about five scenes comprises an ending which will probably polarize viewers into two different camps--those that approve of the choices made by ms . lynch , and those who feel cheated and betrayed by them . personally , i accepted this part of the movie as reasonable , and certainly no more outlandish than what went before . a great deal is explained that would otherwise have remained mystifying . if ms . lynch wanted ambiguity , she should have left things as they were ; if she wanted a clear resolution , she should have added a few more minutes of footage . the general opinion will probably be largely negative , but there are people who will love this film . boxing helena has elements to recommend it , but there's a lot that has to be willingly overlooked to get to that . cynical viewers will not enjoy it , except as something to poke fun at . my own opinion is divided , although i will admit to having enjoyed the picture more than not , but any recommendation i make comes with heavy reservations .",0.58

"it seems that in a period detective story , it's a prerequisite for the the main character to narrate the proceedings . denzel washington's running commentary is peppered with genre-specific cliches , and this voiceover aids atmosphere-building as much as story advancement . as the film progresses , it becomes evident that skin color is more than a background issue--it's the first thing anyone notices , and can break careers , shatter marriages , and end lives . if the resolution of devil in a blue dress is a little flat , the lack of startling revelations or unexpected twists can be forgiven considering the material's depth . capable of being viewed on more than one level , this picture has narrative texture . while devil in a blue dress never develops the taut momentum of franklin's previous effort , one false move , it maintains audience involvement , especially after the first , somewhat slow , half-hour . and , to keep the noir elements from becoming too pervasive , the movie is sprinkled with humor . after portraying a one-dimensional action hero in virtuosity , denzel washington is back to a character with some versatility . easy isn't much of an acting challenge , but washington's mix of charm and intensity creates an appealing personae . the supporting performances , including a brilliant turn by don cheadle as easy's violent friend , are strong . the most interesting element of devil in a blue dress is not the whodunit , but the "" whydunit .

"- so we rented the classic judy garland version from 1939 . beautifully directed by victor fleming , who won the award that year for best director , but for gone with the wind , the wizard of oz is so exquisitely constructed that it's hard to believe that it could have been done any other way . but there were scenes deleted , including a jitterbug number , and others that were almost excised , including the key "" over the rainbow "" number . the cast , which seems etched in stone now like a cinematic mount rushmore , was not exactly what the studio wanted . opening to a bleak kansas landscape , filmed in a nostalgic , sepiatone black-and-white , dorothy wants to be anywhere but boring old home . after a long dream sequence that bursts forth in bright primary colors and imaginative sets , the story ends in that same monotone kansas that it began but with dorothy wanting never to leave home again . just as the mythical sets for oz are not meant to be real , so the sets for the kansas farm are so obviously done on a sound stage that they too have a poetic realism that transcends the literal . most "" family "" pictures aren't . at best they are kids' movies that keep the adults' attention with sufficient humor aimed at them . with judy garland as dorothy , frank morgan as the wizard ( as well as many other roles ) , ray bolger as the scarecrow , bert lahr as the cowardly lion and jack haley as the tin woodman , the ensemble cast never ceases to delight and amaze us . every scene brings some new joy or gem of wisdom such as the "" brainless "" tin woodman's observation that "" some people without brains do an awful lot of talking .

"much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semi-autobiographical novel of george orwell . there's a point to be made in this 1930s depression satire about money counting for everything , and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story , until it gets to be not only redundant , but outright irritating to hear . the story quickly makes its point , as valid as it might be in orwell's novel , here it seems trivial , that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing , when they would be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly belong . it's a fair enough point made , but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point , where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewer's heart . even the scenes of poverty are sugar-coated , making everything look so awfully nice . something gordon can't do . it also , somehow , stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common , cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends . the message i got , as i watched this tepid middle-brow , so-called art film , is that living in poverty can be stifling , and that kind of life is not what makes an artist . for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values - it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values . its final message is that there is no escape from one's destiny . if one looked hard enough , there can be found some wit in gordon's portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary . but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful . you'll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film .",0.3
"at times , to the film's benefit , this sermonizing is seamlessly integrated into the story . on other occasions , it sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb , since there's nothing more uncomfortable or obvious than when a moral calls attention to itself . the primary theme of the war is that violence , irrespective of its motivation , is never justified . the anti-war stance taken by the war works primarily because of a tremendous performance from a potentially unlikely source : kevin costner . as long as stephen is on screen , the message never threatens to overwhelm the story . to a lesser degree , the war imparts the lesson that racism is bad . while it's impossible to argue with the sentiment , the presentation is flawed . in addition to costner's effective performance , mare winningham , lexi randall , and latoya chisholm are all solid and believable , easily holding their own in crucial scenes . elijah wood is somewhat less successful . jon avnet , whose previous feature was fried green tomatoes , recaptures a great deal of the "" feel "" of that 1992 release here ( including a heavy dose of maudlin , manipulative sentiment ) . the '70s tone is aided by an unnecessary and occasionally-intrusive soundtrack that may have been "" inspired "" by the success of the forrest gump cd . whatever failings the war may exhibit , however , it is still solid entertainment , and there are moments of sublime beauty and rare power . even at its most affecting and manipulative , the film never strays from its message or allows its high production values to decline , and that's a lot more than can be said of a great deal of other current theatrical releases .",0.77
"it is turturro's love message to the theater . this play-within-a-film , much like bullets over broadway or shakespeare in love , but not up to both of those film's achievements , nevertheless it manages to develop a somewhat pleasing storyline and some amusing comic moments . it is flawed by its uneven drama and how easy it is to lose track of what is going on because of all the characters the story tries to portray . the second memorable performer is umberto bevalaqua ( walken ) , the detested theater critic , who plays the part of a fop , excessively showing his outrageous mannerisms . the scene works as farce , and it gives the story some needed life . when walken is onscreen the film has movement and excitement , when he's not , the film just doesn't hold up as well . life in the theater gets juxtaposed within the film ; its story going back and forth with contrasting details , such as the latest gossip or romance , the vanity of the players , and the strange love they have for the theater . their romance outside the play mirrors their romance in the film , and one can therefore imply that it mirrors their real life romance . she easily handles this charming but not too difficult role . aida turturro , the real-life cousin of the director , plays a part that makes good use of her huge breasts . the play and the film was overloaded with a flavor of italian , it only seemed odd that the film was staged in new york and not in milan . i can't see a general audience taking to this strictly for the theater crowd film ; it is made mostly for those who love to know what goes on behind the scenes and those who are theater buffs . i applaud the effort and the originality of the film ; but , as for what resulted , i was not overjoyed with this overstuffed production .",0.3

"" it has a lot to say about the human condition , and does so through a small group of characters that we grow to know and care about . occasionally , the film slips off-track with pretentious intellectual spiels on philosophy , but in general a tale of springtime progresses like real life , with superb characterization and deft acting as its hallmarks . a tale of winter , which involves very different situations and characters from those presented in springtime , is even more engrossing than its predecessor . the theme of this film is love , which is something that just about every human can relate to . whatever form love might take--friendship , companionship , passion , sex--a tale of winter examines it . nevertheless , reality is a cruel taskmaster , and felicie is finding it increasingly difficult to define exactly how she feels about maxence and loic . a tale of winter is gripping and engaging , not only because of the mystery of whether felicie will ever again encounter charles , but in its carefully realistic portrayals of her relationships with maxence ( a beautician whom she finds physically attractive ) and loic ( an "" egghead "" whom she finds intellectually stimulating ) . each of these men is a different sort of person , and their interactions with felicie are fascinating to observe . no matter who you are , you're likely to see some element of yourself in one of the three main characters . there are no villains in this film . conflict , while not shunned , is kept to a minimum , and issues are resolved in a sound , rational manner with no hint of melodrama . and , for those who have never seen an upbeat french film , or one with a "" happy ending , "" a tale of winter is likely to surprise . as seems obligatory in any rohmer movie , there are a number of highly-philosophical discussions , some of which run on a little long ( although the excesses present in a tale of springtime are avoided here ) . some of these are engrossing ; others are worthy of a yawn . for those to whom such intellectual interactions do not appeal , there is always the core story . charlotte very is an appealing young actress whose exposure in this movie led to her being cast for a supporting role in blue . the bubbly energy she invests felicie with keeps a tale of winter upbeat , even when things aren't going right . very plays as well off her co-stars as they do off of her , and is plainly the centerpiece of attention . a tale of winter gets its name from shakespeare's the winter's tale , a scene from which is performed during the course of the movie . watch this carefully , since it gives more than a clue as to how felicie's story will be resolved . with a tale of springtime and a tale of winter , eric rohmer has given us a pair of wonderful motion pictures . each deals with the complexities of apparently-simple themes , and utilizes genuine characters and uncontrived situations to work through them . i wonder what summer and autumn will bring .",0.8
"screenplay : john carpenter , debra hill , kurt russell . director : john carpenter . let's face it , this isn't exactly indiana jones we're talking about -- kurt russell's snake plissken last graced theater screens fifteen years ago in escape from new york , when a significant percentage of today's action film audience was somewhere between puberty and mastering solid food , and that film was not what one would call a classic of the genre . the result is an attempt at self-satire which comes off as a tiresome exercise in pyrotechnics and cheap blue screen effects . it is a good thing carpenter , russell and company waited so long between new york and l . a . , because even those who actually saw the first film probably have forgotten enough not to notice that escape from l . a . is virtually a point-for-point remake of the original . the number of duplicated details is quite astonishing , actually . the twist they try to place on escape from l . a . is that it is supposed to be funnier , almost a parody of the original . i say "" supposed to "" because john carpenter may be one of the most humorless directors of the last twenty years , taking even bizarre material like big trouble in little china and deadening it with his brooding style . his idea of a joke in escape from l . a . is showing every possible southern california landmark ( hey , it's universal studios ! . . . hey , it's the queen mary ! ) or making a quick reference to every possible stereotype of los angeles living , and to show that he isn't taking anything seriously with some low-tech special effects , including a computer-generated submarine voyage which makes tron look positively state-of-the-art . a few of the gags are clever , like a shot at l . a .

"date released : varies running length : 1 : 45 rated : nr ( mature themes ) starring : daniel auteuil , emmanuelle beart , andre dussollier , elisabeth bourgine director : claude sautet producers : jean-louis livi and philippe carcassonne screenplay : yves ulmann , jacques fieschi , and jerome tonnere music : maurice ravel released by october films french with english subtitles often foreign films , and french films in particular , are thought of by the average movie-goer as being exceptionally ( and some would say "" overly "" ) intellectual . this could not be more true than for un coeur en hiver , yet it is not merely the mind that this film touches . the rich musical score ( ravel ) is a feast for the ears , and the exceptional performances of the principals leads to several emotionally-potent moments . un coeur en hiver is one of those rare films that can be described as completely satisfying . distilled to its basic essence , the movie is a story that the french do so well : the romantic triangle . beyond the premise , however , there is nothing ordinary about un coeur en hiver . theirs is definitely not a typical tale of clandestine love . rather , it is an examination of the prices of emotional honesty and emotional isolation . oddly enough , it's stephane , the character with the most screen time ( and the man whose heart is "" in winter "" ) who remains much the enigma to the audience . even though we come to identify with him , and understand some of what he does , the depth of his emotions often remains unclear . the last scene of the movie explicitly reveals part of the truth , but for much about stephane , the viewer must reach his or her own conclusions . daniel auteuil plays his role with ability . his is a difficult performance to make succeed , given the ambiguity surrounding stephane , but auteuil has found the perfect balance . at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . camille is no less a complicated character , but her feelings are simpler to read . especially noteworthy is the way that camille's sudden , intense passion for stephane intertwines , and at times conflicts with her lifelong love of music . emmanuelle beart gives an astonishing , unaffected performance . emotion is often displayed in the most subtle and easy-to-miss gestures , expressions , and vocal inflections . not only are her hand movements accomplished , but the look of rapture on her face as she loses herself in the music of ravel is a clear example of how fully ms . beart allowed the personae of camille to enfold her . beart explained the importance of coming to understand music as integral to defining camille : "" [director] claude [sautet] told me from the beginning , 'i will only ask one thing of you ; play the violin . the day you can play the violin , you will be camille . there is nothing more i can tell you about the character . ' "" indeed , it is the importance of music to camille that puts every other emotion in the film , whether displayed by her or by others , into perspective . un coeur en hiver is yet another case of real-life chemistry translating well to the screen . beart and auteuil are companions away from their acting , and the spark of this intensity , even unfulfilled as it is here , is too obvious to miss . with the exceptions of much ado about nothing and sommersby , there have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of un coeur en hiver . strong characters , intelligent writing , and exquisite performances combine to draw the audience into the movie . mental and emotional participation are demanded . this is a movie with deep , churning currents . those who are attracted only to hollywood's shallow waters may find un coeur en hiver too intimidating , but anyone who enjoys a more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope for in this picture .",0.9
"screenplay : tom jankewicz and d . v . devincentis & steve pink and john cusack . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and roger birnbaum . director : george armitage . grosse pointe blank has been bumped from hollywood pictures' release schedule a couple of times , but for once it appears that the delays had nothing to do with production over-runs or shabby quality . my guess is that the marketing people just kept asking for more time to figure out how in the world to sell this thing . when john cusack is your biggest star , the director's previous film ( miami blues ) was seen by next to no one seven years ago and the tone defies even its cute high-concept premise , you'd probably be stumped too . and no matter how they try to sell grosse pointe blank , they won't do it justice . grosse pointe blank is wildly unpredictable , wonderfully detailed and unapologetically intelligent , a comedy which takes the time to do the little things right and gets big laughs in the process . cusack plays martin blank , a killer-for-hire facing an existential crisis . john cusack is one of four credited writers for a script which boasts one of the characteristics of the best screen comedies : every minor character is a fully-realized comic creation . the exchanges between these characters are sharp and clever , rich with sometimes overlapping dialogue which actually requires the audience to pay attention . the punch lines never come quite when or how you expect them , taking deadly satirical aim at targets like organized labor , suburbia , assassin etiquette and that strange american ritual called the high school reunion . at the relatively calm center of this colorful comic hurricane is john cusack , who adds grosse pointe blank to an impressive resume of smart projects like say anything , the grifters , and bullets over broadway . his self-deprecating wit and baby-faced , sad-eyed attractiveness make him an instantly sympathetic screen presence , and cusack has to fight against his persona a bit to give martin the killer instinct he requires . the script gradually reveals bits of martin's history which explain how he became who he is , without sacrificing the comedy for an unnecessarily serious character study . it's a deft piece of acting by cusack , who has an easy chemistry with minnie driver ( in perhaps the least well-developed role ) which convincingly evokes a sense of history and familiarity . as absurd as the situations get in grosse pointe blank , the film never becomes a farce because cusack plays martin's quest for enlightenment as honest and honorable . . . even if he has to stab someone in the throat with a ball point pen along the way . oh , yes . . . grosse pointe blank could catch you off guard if you are unfamiliar with the aforementioned miami blues , director george armitage's under-appreciated 1990 thriller which wasn't timid about mixing comedy , quirky characters and occasionally graphic violence . grosse point blank is a much better , much funnier film , but it does include moments of violence which are sometimes jarring in an otherwise playful film ; martin is a killer , and we see him at work as well as at play . hollywood pictures isn't doing much to warn the squeamish about those elements , preferring instead to emphasize the comedy and a gen-x-nostalgic soundtrack heavy on 1980s punk and new wave tunes by the jam , the clash and others . a bit deceptive , perhaps , but for once i'm willing to forgive the marketing folks their trespasses if they get people into theaters to see grosse pointe blank . something this disarmingly unique needs all the creative salesmanship it can get .",0.8
"this is a wonderfully chaotic work , meriting high praise for what it tried to do and not condemnation for what it failed to do . there's such a thing as something being spoiled because it has too many good things going for it . that is the case with this ensemble dramatic piece , whose most telling fault is that it eventually resembles an overblown soap opera , going on for far too long . its three hours length and many subplots will attest to that , even though it is artfully woven together , but could in all honesty , have enough material for five other movies within it . therefore it is not surprising that the ingenuously talented director , the 29-year-old paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights/hard eight ) , had to finally tie-up all the loose ends of the story into a nice knot , which resulted in an ending that won't please too many because it might seem absurd . but i found myself accepting of its biblical ending and was impressed by the overall stupendous effort of this exuberant film , that is pumped with self-confidence and a virtuoso style . a work that mirrors greatness even if it doesn't quite keep that greatness in proper focus . the film does go on for too long , with the only thing that could save it from never ending is a biblical miracle , but it settles instead for a plague right out of exodus in the bible to make its farewell . that improbable ending was set up and apologized for in its prologue by the offscreen narrator , who explained three different bizarre chance happenings as unlikely but possible , giving cause for the improbable ending the film comes up with , and after all , how absurd could that ending be , if the bible used the same material ! the reward the viewer gets for sitting through the long and highly structured but at times confusing film , that tries to picture life as being a matter of coincidences , is how brilliant the individual skits were and how fine the acting was . even tom cruise , as his estranged son , playing an obnoxious hustling infomercials maker for the product he is selling to men , so that they can conquer women , was done with a blend of humor and pathos , making his role less obnoxious than it could have been . in a role that reminded me , of jean-pierre leaud' outlandish performance in "" irma vep . "" here , cruise goes for the jugular , as a boorish male predator , someone who is just plain unlikable and prone to going off on rants . cruise is becoming a noticeably more polished actor ever since his kubrick stint in "" eyes wide shut , "" and deserves much praise for this role . they are all-tied together too neatly and the outcome of their sufferings is too predictable for my taste . but that can't begin to explain how penetrating a human drama this is and how acutely aware the young director is of the people's misery and heartaches he highlights . he is mostly guilty of being excessive , wanting to put too much of a good thing on the plate , in this robert altman's short cuts-nashville like production . but anderson offers more meat in his character's parts than did altman and more finesse in telling his story , allowing his actors to expand their roles more . the performances by all were superb , but reilly's and hoffman's were better than superb , in a film that didn't have a featured player , but allowed each performer to take his or her time telling their story , as anderson was able to create a somewhat seamless work out of this separate skits , making use of different camera angles , using tv intercutting methods , fast-cut editing , and utilizing a provocative visual style . he also made the story seem fresh and moving in many different directions to catch all the personalities involved in the story . he also made use of a song , through the performance of aimee mann , who somewhere more than half-way through the film , sings the theme song of the film , and it is heard first by one character , then another , until all the film's troubled souls are brought together by a single refrain . "" it's not . . . whatever fault one might find with the film , that fault is countered by how interesting and refreshing the film felt , and with the director's flair for taking risks . the unbelievable tale puts one into the mood of the magic happening onscreen , and the magic was not necessarily in what was extraordinary and not in the cleverly plotted coincidences , but in the telling tragedies of the lost souls and their injured psyches , casualities that are inevitable in america's modern world of consumerism .",0.7

"contact is likely to change a lot of perceptions -- not only about the role of humankind in the universe , but about what special effects can do for a movie when they're used in the service of a story , rather than the other way around . contact is that rare big-budget motion picture that places ideas , characters , and plot above everything else . the film takes the richness of astronomer carl sagan's bestselling 1985 novel and re-invents it for the screen , retaining all the power and fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not disappoint devoted fans . contact is as close as recent hollywood productions have come to a perfect example of cinema . all the elements are not only in place , but effectively realized . this is the kind of motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a large budget is used wisely . the participation of a superlative cast and crew doesn't always guarantee success , but , in this case , the high expectations have been met . the film is directed and co-produced by robert zemeckis , whose last effort was 1994's box office smash , forrest gump . as an on-again/off-again amateur astronomer , one of the first things i noticed about the film was its technical accuracy . this is undoubtedly the result of sagan's influence . all the details are correct ( at least as far as i was able to determine ) ; there are none of the movie cop-outs that film makers occasionally resort to in order to lower the intelligence level of the script . contact is believable in part because it doesn't replace true science with vague terms and gobbledygook . in his novel , sagan was careful to make everything , even the most farfetched parts , theoretically feasible . although the movie changes and condenses significant aspects of the original material , it remains true to this vision . contact opens with an unforgettable sequence that takes the viewer on a tour of the universe . it starts out in a familiar corner of space , with earth filling the screen . it's an amazing trip that only takes several minutes , but presages the wonders that contact's final half-hour holds for the viewer . although contact is rightfully being billed as the story of humanity's first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form , at its heart , it's really more about ellie and her quest for meaning in life . in her own words : "" for as long as i can remember , i've been searching for some reason why we're here -- what we're doing here , who are we ? "" ellie's trajectory places her on a collision course with answers to those questions , and it's the development of her character , and the resolution of this particular aspect of the story , that makes for a satisfying conclusion . in the end , the science fiction elements become subordinate to the personal ones . in its own unique way , contact offers a little bit of almost everything : drama , romance , suspense , and science fiction . it touches the emotions and the intellect . there are glorious special effects , wonderful acting , and a couple of impressive pyrotechnic displays . the plot contains the most believable approach to this subject matter ever presented in a movie . as he did in forrest gump , robert zemeckis makes excellent use of special effects . the standout sequences are those that take place in deep space and give us an awe-inspiring perception of how incredibly vast the universe is . but digital trickery , both subtle and obvious , is used on other occasions , as well . by carefully editing clips of clinton speeches and using a little creative dubbing , zemeckis makes it seem like the president is directly addressing the specific situations that arise during the course of contact . the cast is strong . tom skerritt and james woods take what could have been one-dimensional characters and develop them into something more . we don't exactly sympathize with them , but we understand their viewpoints . but the star of the film is jodie foster , who brings all of her considerable ability to the part of ellie , and infuses the character with passion , intelligence , and courage . foster deserves another oscar nomination for her work here . instead , in different ways , this movie recalls some of the best science fiction films . in fact , contact can stand on the same level as these and many other classics , and that is one definition of a great movie . if contact falls short in any area , it's an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots , but , given the time limitations of the medium ( the running length is already 2 : 30 ) , that's understandable . this is one of 1997's finest motion pictures , and is a forceful reminder that hollywood is still capable of making magic .

"a fluff sitcom , romantic comedy , that is so charming that it eventually suffocates on all the charm it gives off . it is cleverly written and directed by irish playwright gerard sternbridge , who can't stop showing off how clever he is able to make his main character . the film was shot almost a year before "" almost famous "" made kate hudson into a celebrity , and a golden globe winner and oscar nominee for best supporting actress . in any case , kate does a flawless irish accent . he's a bullshit artist extraordinaire , with an easy manner about him , who cunningly knows how to reach out to women , which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but after that became annoying . his gracious smile soon looked too smug and unbecoming , as the story had no particular meaning to it and i have seen too many recent films with studs in it to care how this silly story resolved itself . this film resolved itself in the cute way the story was heading , a 'feel good' film for those with an amoral bent and a belief that having sex with as many women as possible is the best thing one can do to improve relationships . for all the main characters there's a voice-over used to spell out their thoughts and also captions of their thoughts are at times flashed onscreen . scenes are also repeated so we get reactions from different individuals . the film's main purpose seems to be in showing what a likable rake adam is -- that he is willing to meet the needs of whomever he's with . he proves that having secrets in a relationship can add spice to it and make it an even more serene and lasting one . this is contrasted with adam being shown by the film's end as a pathological liar and an uncaring sexist . the film's image of him left me confused about what i was supposed to think of him . but my gut reaction is , i had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this vacuous story unsatisfying . it was like i was being asked to overlook adam's failings and be won over by his obviously trite charms . i wasn't and therefore didn't care for adam , or the film , or did i particularly care for any of the sisters . the only thing i liked in the film was the jaguar , and i didn't care how adam got it or what story he told about how he got it . that was supposed to be funny and show that he might have some problems with telling the truth .",0.3
"mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity ) running time : 121 minutes . it won't be difficult for many viewers to accept denzel washington as a character sent straight from heaven . . . particularly female viewers . washington has been a regular on "" sexiest man "" lists , dazzling audiences with his confident smile while building an impressive body of work in roles characterized by intensity , integrity and -- frequently -- inscrutability . yet for all his obvious talent and good looks , he has often seemed unapproachable on screen , so cool that he fails to be warm . the preacher's wife comes as a welcome addition to washington's resume , a somewhat predictable holiday confection buoyed by washington's engaging lead performance . it is equally natural to expect a certain amount of holy-rolling in such an effort , but the preacher's wife does a fairly good job of walking the fine line between sincere and sanctimonious . penny marshall ( big , awakenings ) has shown herself to be that rare contemporary director who can make a "" feel-good "" film which doesn't leave you feeling insulted , and she generally avoids saccharine overload . the major problem with the preacher's wife is the same problem which has characterized most of marshall's films : it's just too long . her movies have a tendency to run out of gas with a lot of film left to run , and the preacher's wife could have benefited from plenty of additional editing . much of it could have come from whitney houston's performance , which consists largely of finding reasons to break into song like elvis presley in one of his carefully crafted vehicles . houston certainly has a spectacular voice , and it is nice to hear her using it for gospel standards rather than dreary ballads , but half a dozen musical numbers simply pushes the limit and pads the running time . little justin pierre edmond should have been another strong candidate for the editor's knife ; the button-cute rascal is one of the worst child actors i have seen on screen in years . thankfully , denzel washington is on hand to provide a jolt whenever the preacher's wife needs it most . his first appearance may be a shock to those who know him best as serious , determined characters in films like malcolm x , crimson tide and courage under fire : dropped from the sky into the snow , looking decidedly dapper in a grey suit , hat and topcoat , washington's dudley proceeds to celebrate his return to corporeal form by spinning around on the ground like one of the three stooges . his innocence and earnestness are thoroughly charming , and his scenes with courtney b . vance ( effective as the real principal character of the story ) have a particular appeal . if there isn't much chemistry between washington and houston , well , that's not really the point of the preacher's wife . besides , denzel washington is a chemical reaction all by himself , and it is a pleasure to see that he can sparkle as well as he smolders .",0.6

"with a title like the man who knew too little , one might reasonably assume that actor bill murray's latest endeavor is a parody of hitchcock's twice-made film , the man who knew too much . in fact , although the movie takes a few stabs at mocking hitchcockian plot twists , it's mainly a satire of the james bond pictures . unlike many similar productions , this one has a smart , knowing script that understands just how to play up all the tricks and contrivances of the secret agent genre to their best comic effect . it's a breezy , fun film that offers more than a few solid laughs . it's vitally impossible for the premise of a mistaken identity to sustain an entire motion picture , but the man who knew too little employs enough variations that , until the very end , proceedings remain surprisingly lively . of course , it could be argued that the situation in this film is so outrageous that it's as much a "" fish out of water "" scenario as a "" mistaken identity "" one . there's a little of crocodile dundee's charm at work here . for roughly three-quarter of the film's 93-minute running time , director jon amiel ( copycat ) keeps things rolling along , effectively blending satire with almost every imaginable variation on the mistaken identity plot device . however , since this is essentially a one-joke movie , it runs out of steam before the end credits arrive . the last twenty minutes of the man who knew too little are a little too repetitious , and even a brief appearance by respected british actress geraldine james ( the jewel in the crown ) in an over-the-top role as a torturer can't restore the film's earlier inventiveness . despite the floundering ending , the man who knew too little still leaves a favorable impression , and the closing scenes are not completely without humor . murray recovers nicely from his elephantine flop , larger than life , to essay a character who is both likable and funny . most of the humor here works ? including a mugging where things don't go as planned , a boatload of double-entendres , a unique car chase through a construction zone , and a hilarious bit with some nasal spray . although the man who knew too little is less audacious than austin powers and lacks all of the '70s references , it's frequently as enjoyable , if not moreso , and that makes it a worthy choice for a frothy , funny evening .

"the joy luck club , as stated in the movie's opening narrative , is a collection of four aging chinese women bound together more by hope than by joy or luck . since i didn't count , i can't verify this statement , but it sounds about right . taken as a whole , all of these vignettes combine to lend greater meaning to the whole . the joy luck club is the sum total of its parts with common themes giving solid grounding and greater resonance to the overall film . as bass comments , "" i saw all the mothers' and daughters' stories as facets of the same experience . that's the genius of the book , and if we cut it down to just a couple of stories it would be like any other movie . "" the stories are not told in such a manner as to seem pared down or truncated , nor is their presentation confusing , thanks to a cleverly- orchestrated framing scene with the principal characters gathered together . however , it is apparent that a lot more could have been told , and we're left wondering about all that we didn't get to see . the characters are mostly well-developed , but it's tantalizing to consider just how much fuller some of them could have been with a different plot structure . but there are always sacrifices to be made , and no movie can tell everything about the lives of the people it introduces . one of the themes of sleepless in seattle is that there are some "" guy movies "" and some "" chick movies . "" if this is true , then the joy luck club fits into the latter category . certainly , a tear-jerker like this is likely to find more open acceptance among women than among men . that's not necessarily because men won't like it , but some will be too embarrassed to admit that they enjoyed something as emotional as this . in fact , there are those who may refuse to see it to avoid this possible dilemma altogether . nevertheless , there will be a group of people who will genuinely dislike the joy luck club , and i can't say that their reasoning is entirely flawed . the movie has a few moments that can justifiably be described as cloying and manipulative , and those who are offended by these methods are going to become annoyed at the joy luck club . die-hard cynics are advised to stay clear . what the aforementioned people have missed , however , is that the scenes that don't work are far fewer in number than those that do , and most of these can easily be overlooked in piecing together the overall intent of the motion picture . few movies are without at least a problem or two , and it's more difficult to put together a flawless production when going for the emotional payoffs that this film does . the joy luck club is clearly--perhaps too clearly--an adaptation of a book . the dialogue is often too poetic to be real , and the story too clearly plotted to be acceptable as anything more than an imperfect reflection of the world we live in . i hasten to add that this is not a bad thing , but it is evidence that this movie , through its willingness to loosen the strings of realism , expects a certain suspension of disbelief from the audience . personally , i never identified with any of the characters , but i became involved in their stories . that is to say , never did i make a connection between something in my own life and what i was seeing on screen , but that in no way diminished the impact of what was being presented . i venture to say that many women , especially those who have had tempestuous relationships with their mothers or daughters , will have an entirely different viewpoint . the line between drama and melodrama is a fine one , and most of the joy luck club successfully navigates the tightrope , staying on the more powerful dramatic side . there are times when it slips and comes across as heavy-handed . you know something isn't right when it becomes apparent that certain lines of dialogue and character actions are trying desperately to make you , as a member of the audience , shed a tear . whether or not these incidents do what they're trying to is another matter entirely . . . . wayne wang , whose best-known previous film was dim sum , shows significant ability in the way he has structured this movie . many are played by more than one actor ( as children then adults , for example ) , but all changes are smooth and seamless . it's as easy to accept a little girl as waverly as it is the beautiful , sophisticated-looking tamlyn tomita , and that's because the characters transcend the performers portraying them . it's fascinating and satisfying the way that the diverse threads are knitted together into a single tapestry . some might complain that this movie is a downer , but those who do , fail to recognize that the joy luck club's message is one of hope , and that catharsis and emotional fulfillment often come through tragedy . sure , a lot of bad things happen during the course of this film , but at the end , the tears are of happiness and new beginnings , not loss .",0.84
"the story of their adventures might have included beautiful wildlife photography , tense moments of realistic clashes with nature and the wonder of the natural world which made marty stouffer's "" wild america "" series a success . that's not the kind of film you can expect hollywood to make about this kind of story , however . the bulk of the film is in fact set in the wilds of america , but it's not likely to inspire much reverence for nature . for every moment of grandeur like a stampede of wild horses , there are encounters played almost entirely for laughs : a tussle with an alligator , a ride on a moose's horns , a cave full of bears dozing off to a lullaby which concludes with a chorus of flatulence . these scenes will likely entertain young audience members , but they hardly inspire much respect for majestic beasts . the low-brow comedy in wild america is frustrating enough , but dear and screenwriter david michael wieger aren't even willing to commit to being low-brow . the wilderness-based second act of wild america ain't art , but at least it tries to entertain . the twenty minutes between the boys' return to fort smith and the closing credits crawl by with an agonizing sincerity . then again , wild america isn't really about parents letting go , either , any more than it's about learning to respect nature . judging by an audience comprised largely of teen and pre-teen girls , wild america is really about its cute trio of teen stars . in retrospect , this conglomeration of themes does have one guiding principle . it's a cross between "" national geographic "" and "" tiger beat .

"screenplay : leslie bohem . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i have been anticipating the arrival of dante's peak , the first of 1997's two volcano films , with a combination of dread and . . . well , still more dread . the return of the disaster film has been about as welcome a pop culture phenomenon as 70s nostalgia , both of them reincarnating uncalculated vapidity as calculated vapidity . it only takes one twister to turn you off the genre ; throw in independence day and daylight and any critic could be excused for walking into dante's peak with an attitude . but if i have to sit through more disaster films , i only hope they can be as thrilling as dante's peak . though just as plot- and character-impaired as its genre cousins , dante's peak delivers a solid hour of relentless tension and excitement . dante's peak is a strange kind of success , because it includes many of the noteworthy flaws of twister , and then some . we get the same obligatory romantic pair thrown into danger with a minimalist back-story tagged on , along with a team of quirky scientists to provide comic relief . brosnan is ruddy and somber for most of the film's running time , hamilton is frazzled and likeable , and both of them trudge dutifully through fifty minutes of exposition as though any unnecessary acting might tire them out before the big finish . leslie bohem ( the scripter of record on daylight , apparently a specialist in films which end with traumatized people wrapped in heavy blankets ) also adds a dose of jaws , but doesn't give us the pleasure of an actual villain . charles hallahan provides the political voice who ends up causing more damage , and there is a teasing sub-plot about a potentially skittish business developer . neither one offers enough conflict , however , forcing the audience to sit and wait out the plodding first half for the big show . and what a show it turns out to be . the surprising thing about the post-eruption second half of dante's peak isn't necessarily that it is effective , but that the reason for its effectiveness doesn't exist entirely on a hard drive somewhere . there are certainly a few impressive visual effects sequences , including a cloud packing the concussive force of a small nuclear weapon , but director roger donaldson gets just as much mileage out of the time-honored technique of jiggling the camera to represent an earthquake . no , dante's peak is an effective thriller because the characters repeatedly find themselves in new and apparently impossible situations , and the direction gives those sequences an edge-of-the-seat tension . from a dizzying truck ride through town destined for the universal studios tour , to the crossing of a flood-threatened bridge , to a mine shaft which threatens to turn brosnan into a sardine , dante's peak provides the kind of relentless , well-crafted action which is what movie-goers should be talking about when they talk about certain films being like roller-coasters . the biggest surprise of all may be that the man behind that action is donaldson , who has served up cinematic backwash like species , the getaway and cocktail . it is an eerie moment , and donaldson manages to get you itching for the fate of the characters even though they haven't been given any personalities . more impressive still , he does it without assaulting your senses . there is , however , something rare in a film which can generate the kind of tension dante's peak generates . maybe it is possible to present a disaster without being one .",0.7
"rather , it is a sort of pakistani version of the commitments , with the focus of the band being country/western music rather than r&b . wild west is a culture clash movie with a twist . this time , it's not pakistanis trying to fit in with whites , but pakistanis trying to be accepted as country/western musicians . the film has the good sense to approach this issue--not to mention several others--with a fair dose of humor , so while the point is made , it's accomplished without a sermon . this is a lighthearted romp , not a lugubrious piece of moralizing . director david attwood has managed to infuse his entire film with energy and zest--not only the characters , but the story itself . if the pacing is occasionally erratic , it's because attwood rarely slows down , and when he does ( usually for a moment of straight drama--such as the scenes where zaf's mother talks to him about going to pakistan ) , the audience feels the lull . occasionally , the film is a little too obvious . attwood creates a number of intentional stereotypes , but these don't always work . the "" typical american "" record producers are an example . as sendups , this pair is a little too annoying ( although the biting satire surrounding them fits wild west's mood perfectly ) . wild west never attains the flair of the commitments . in the first place , the music isn't as good or as all-pervasive . additionally , attwood's film is never that concerned about burrowing under the characters' skins . wild west isn't shallow , but it glosses over numerous issues to preserve the light tone . this could have easily become a dark , brooding motion picture . all the performers are likeable . naveen andrews shows good range as zaf , and seems perfectly at home in a cowboy hat and jacket . ameet chana , who plays the honky tonk cowboys' manager , gives an occasionally-hilarious over-the-top performance , seizing on every americanism and cliche he can find . wild west works because of its reckless spirit . the message about people's intolerance of diversity comes across all the more clearly because it isn't shrouded in long speeches and mournful testimonials . david attwood has chosen his medium well for wild west to become something with a little more substance than a typical farce .",0.65
"director chris columbus's stepmom , which would have more appropriately been titled mommy's dying , wants to be two movies . as seen in the film's light-hearted trailers , stepmom wants to be a comedic look at the perils of being a stepmother , and , indeed , the movie's first act sticks to that plan . rather than examining the relatively unexplored territory of stepmothering , the movie wants , most of all , to be another terminal illness picture , of which we have one a month . the maudlin script , by a committee of no less than 5 writers , expects you to bring extra tissues and use every one of them . in a stellar performance , susan sarandon plays jackie , the obsessively prepared and sanctimonious mother . the treacly script has a throwaway and not credible subplot about her being fired for trying to mix a career with parenting . "" mommy , if you want me to hate her i will , "" he tells jackie with a sincere innocence . well , duh ! the film is at its best when it tries to grapple with the issues and conflicts surrounding divorce and remarriage .

"when i got my invitation to come to the press screening of ridicule , i had heard nothing about the film . i immediately assumed i was off to another dumb college flick like the disaster glory daze . i had the image of a bunch of neanderthal youngsters insulting each other with bathroom humor . how wrong i was . ridicule is a french satire and costume drama set in the late eighteenth century in last days of french monarchy before the revolution . it is a fairly inaccessible film , but ultimately a rewarding one . once you realize the obtuse story is inconsequential and that the film is strictly a comedy of manners , you can relax and enjoy its subtleties . it is a beautifully filmed show ( thierry arbogast ) that is easy on the eyes . the movie opens with a truly shocking scene that includes male frontal nudity . it is not the nudity itself that is shocking , but what happens . curiously enough , the movie could probably get a pg or pg-13 rating without this scene , but with it in , it is certainly destined for an r if the producers end up submitting it to the mpaa for a rating . at the time of the press screening , it appeared to be as yet unrated . after this surprising scene , the opening credits begin to roll and the audience is already shocked and confused . the confusion stays , but the shock subsides . the show has a simple story , but it is presented with enough subplots and characters to leave the audience baffled for quite some time . as i said earlier , ignore this and wait for the heart of the picture when the show becomes a condemnation of and a ridicule of the aristocracy's obsession with ridicule as a form of witty conversation . the show even concludes with a lavish and totally ridiculous costume ball where the gowns ridicule their wearers . the title ridicule has many meanings and nuance in the show . wit during that period consisted entirely of cleverly worded put-downs , i . e . , ridicule . the dialog by screenwriter remi waterhouse is masterful . bellegarde likes the young man , proclaiming of him , "" honesty and wit are so rarely combined . "" this is one of many unnecessary complications in the plot . attempt to ignore it . bellegarde guides his young pupil in the fine art of disparagement warning him , don't laugh at your own jokes and "" don't laugh with your mouth open . it's too rustic .

"for what it's worth , i correctly guessed the identity of the killer in scream 2 . . . well , sort of . i suppose i should feel satisfied at my own cleverness , since dimension and the makers of scream 2 have put so much effort into keeping that piece of information secret . even more so than in the original scream , writer kevin williamson goes to ridiculous extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit , so ridiculous that the film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least important . as a horror film , it's a solid piece of work ; as a satire , it's frequently hilarious . as a mystery , it tries way , way , _way_ too hard . jermaine ? marlon ? tito ? if you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit , more power to you . williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm everything else . it all builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions , motives and false finishes -- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there . i'm being a bit harder on scream 2 than it might deserve , because that one big problem may be the only real problem . williamson's satirical darts are expertly targeted , not just at horror film cliches or the "" inevitable inferiority "" of sequels , but at the original film itself . the film-within-a-film "" stab "" provides a few wonderful moments , as do the audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations ( e . g . the dialogue is sharp , smart and not at all afraid of naming names ( cox's "" friends "" co-stars david schwimmer and jennifer aniston are among those skewered ) , a perfect counter-point to wes craven's crafty suspense scenes . if you're not ready to crawl out of your skin when campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her tormentor , it's time for a pulse check . scream 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration . kevin williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to be finding an audience -- both screams and i know what you did last summer take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea . there's just something deflating about a tense , comic horror film that turns into a scooby-doo episode . williamson has too much talent as a writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions , even if they're conventions he's helping to re-create . scare us or make us laugh . . . we know you can do both . just keep the mystery machine parked at the curb . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.7

"i read that it is a sequel to the year my voice broke , which i have not seen , but there were no references to it in this film which effectively stands alone . the last part of the picture is an honest and insightful consideration of adolescent sex . up until the last part , the picture is pure formula and reminded me of a dozen other films . the characters are pleasant enough , but very familiar . if you rent the tape , hang in there because in the last twenty minutes or so the film comes into its own and has something fresh to say . this mass mooning is pretty sophomoric film making . from there the script by the director john duigan takes the standard turns . little happens that you haven't seen before , and the acting , although good , is nothing special . as one of many ways the script just follows the standard formula , all of the teachers are mean and strict . the only question is the degree . these are issues that teenagers have to grapple with today , and this film treats them tenderly and honestly . after having no meaningful music in most of the film , even the music comes alive in the end . i had a problem with the cinematography . the nighttime sequences across the lake are filmed in luminescent darkness so that it looked like a scene from the arabian nights . whereas this worked , most of the film was in sepia tones of the interiors . this looked more dreary than nostalgic which was i think was the intention of the tones . flirting runs a little long at 1 : 39 given the repetitive material . it is in australian english without subtitles . i have seen a lot of non-american english shows so i was able to follow it , but it may leave some dazed and confused . the film is rated r . there is brief nudity , a little sex , mild language , and the violence of a boxing match . it is close to pg-13 , and i think the show would be fine for mature kids as young as 11 or 12 . although i still can not figure out how at least one critic had this film on his best of the year's list , i did like it because the formulaic script finally had something to say toward the end . i give the show a mild thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 26 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6
"it has long been recognized that hitler's final solution exterminated more than jews . to this date , most films have examined the tragedy from the jewish point-of-view . a select few , such as steven spielberg's oscar- winning schindler's list , have presented the truth with heartbreaking , gut-wrenching clarity . rarely , however , has a motion picture attempted what bent does : show the holocaust through the eyes of two gay men enduring a grueling existence at the dachau concentration camp . unfortunately , what begins with an interesting premise and a promising first half quickly devolves into a boring , muddled , melodramatic love story . by all accounts , the live version is both startling and moving . the motion picture version is neither -- something critical was lost in the translation , even though playwright martin sherman wrote the screenplay . many of the things that can work in a play , when the live nature of the production allows an intimate rapport to develop between the actors and the audience , fail on the big screen . the final fifty minutes of bent are a prime example . the movie's first half is more successful . once the movie reaches dachau , it grinds to a screeching halt . this particular activity is not inherently cinematic in nature and bent's banal , repetitious dialogue does little to liven it up . gradually , the tediousness of the second half sucks all of the potential drama ( not to mention the energy ) out of the film . we give up caring whether the characters live or die . they don't have anything interesting to say , and the scene in which they engage in "" verbal sex "" borders on being unintentionally funny . solid performances from lead actors clive owen and lothaire bluteau go in vain . the final scene , which is supposed to be a triumphant crowd- pleaser , comes across as obvious and overplayed . one thing i don't doubt is director sean mathias' sincerity . bent is obviously an important story for him ; it's just that he and writer martin sherman made too many bad choices in adapting the play . in fact , bent's most important contribution may be to illustrate by comparison how powerful a movie like schindler's list truly is .

"if you've ever seen or read an interview with vincent gallo , it's probably obvious why he decided to make his own movie : other people seem to irritate him to distraction . so rather than make a film with all the folks he holds in such contempt , gallo decided to do it all himself . wearing that many hats should qualify him as some sort of rack . fortunately , gallo has the head and the talent to pull it off for the most part . a visually provocative if occasionally under-developed character study , buffalo '66 tells the story of billy brown ( gallo ) , a lifetime loser from buffalo , ny . the premise sounds like the set-up for farce or black comedy , but buffalo '66 is actually a sharply-observed character study . gallo's billy is a portrait in emotional immaturity , his child-like name indicative of his inability to act like an adult . gallo is superb in front of the camera , but he's just as impressive behind it . typically , actors-turned-directors point their camera at the actors and let them do their thing . there's nothing typical about gallo , however . his direction tends towards the showy , but the show always reaches for a specific emotion . with the instincts of a visual artist , gallo makes buffalo '66 undeniably visual . it's only as a screenwriter that gallo comes up wanting . as complex and well-developed as billy may be , layla is that sketchy . the talented ricci tries to invest some real humanity in the character , but too often she's little more than a powder blue baby-doll fantasy . that choice only makes sense if buffalo '66 is an elaborate surrealist fable , which would negate much of the compelling pathos in billy's character . still , it's hard not to notice how much more gallo does right with buffalo '66 . he may have stretched his diverse talents thin , but he proved he could do it his way . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.7
"screenplay/director : mike leigh . i can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing mike leigh's naked . on the one hand , it is a rather unpleasant visceral experience with troubling images of violence against women ; on the other hand , it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a tour-de-force performance by david thewlis . yet for my money , there is another level at which naked approaches brilliance . this film is a warning designed for the self rather than for society , a startling examination of one mind's response to dehumanization . with johnny , mike leigh has created a magnificent character who serves as a prophet of the apocalypse , an apocalypse he describes in terms rather different from what one might expect . and on and on , too many instances to mention , all connected to johnny's larger obsession with evolution . the title of the film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe : when all the frills are stripped away , we're just big monkeys , monkeys who seem to have stopped reaching for more . all the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted for little withough a perfect actor for johnny , and david thewlis is that actor . his sarcastic , often bilious musings easily could have come off as smug and self-congratulatory , but thewlis pours a great deal of emotion into his lines . yes , he believes that he is more aware than those around him , but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge , instead finding only disgust with it . thewlis is supported by several other fine performances , most notable claire skinner's small but memorable role as the frantic sondra ; only cruttwell rings false with his slimy sebastian . naked is not without its faults . an encounter between johnny and a young scots couple who can't seem to find one another is funny , but doesn't really connect to the rest of the film . the sebastian character is way too much , too crudely drawn to work as the representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be . naked has a semblance of a narrative through-line , but basically it's a collection of snapshots viewed through johnny's singular lens , and that collection can appear somewhat unfocused . but from its first jarring frames to its final shot of johnny limping down a london street , it risks showing us the side of ourselves we don't like to see , and hoping we won't turn away .",0.8
"the first thing to note about waiting to exhale , forest whitaker's theatrical feature debut as a director , is that it will likely be a huge success with its target audience . many black women will see themselves in this motion picture , and , subconsciously using their personal background to fill in gaps left by the screenplay , they will declare this film a triumph . i wish i could be as positive with my opinion , but i found waiting to exhale to be seriously flawed -- a string of connected vignettes that propel the four main characters along easily predicted character arcs . of the quartet of stories , bernadine's is the most compelling . it's no coincidence that this character is played by angela bassett , the best actress in the cast . needless to say , bernadine doesn't react well to this news and her response -- torching his car with all his possessions in it -- will almost certainly garner loud cheers from women in the audience . although not as interesting as bernadine , loretta devine's gloria offers some worthwhile moments . waiting to exhale's other two characters -- savannah ( whitney houston ) and robin ( lela rochon ) -- are basically separate aspects of the same personality . neither of these stories is of more than passing interest , and the movie slows to a crawl when houston or rochon takes center stage . whitaker's direction , like the tone , is uneven . some of the switches from comedy to drama are forced and abrupt . that said , however , waiting to exhale contains a fair number of genuinely humorous sequences , many of which make pointed comments about male insensitivity . there are also several memorable serious scenes , the best of which team angela bassett with wesley snipes . not only does this pair sizzle , but the dialogue is intelligently-written and the performances are on- target . the most significant fault in waiting to exhale is its character presentation . with the exception of bernadine , i never felt anything for the women populating this film , as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy . part of this can be attributed to bland performances by houston and rochon , but the script must bear an equal share of the burden . no doubt about it -- this is a "" women's movie "" ( or , as it's alternatively referred to , a "" chick flick "" ) , but it's among the year's weakest . of all those films , however , this one has the most artificial and disjointed "" feel "" . personally , i don't buy the "" male bashing "" accusation that has been leveled at waiting to exhale . the treatment of men in the movie seems fine , and there are other problems more worthy of attention . given the dearth of significant roles for black women in motion pictures , it's refreshing to see these four bonding on the big screen -- and that's almost reason enough for this film to have been made . nevertheless , it's difficult to deny that another layer of substance is needed to lift the movie about this superficial level of melodrama .",0.56

"cast : peter pryor , kevin dinovis , jason centeno , elizabeth casey director : kevin dinovis producer : richard goldberg screenplay : kevin dinovis cinematography : jonathan kovel music : christopher matarazzo the fact that kevin dinovis' debut feature , surrender dorothy , won the grand jury prize at the 1998 slamdance film festival should be a warning signal to anyone expecting something even remotely mainstream . surrender dorothy is startling , gripping , disturbing , and out on the film making edge . it's the kind of movie that we don't see enough of because its commercial prospects are so limited . this kind of picture is unlikely to appeal to typical movie-goers ( or , for that matter , even to a significant portion of the art house crowd ) , and , as a result , directors stay away from this sort of in-your-face excursion into psychological deviance and obsession . surrender dorothy betrays its low budget through its 16 mm black- and-white print . rather than detracting from the experience , however , the grainy , almost primitive-looking cinematography enhances the film's effectiveness , lending an almost-documentary quality to the proceedings that offsets the twisted fairy tale quality of the narrative . the movie's look is perfect for the story ; color or even a crisper black- and-white would not have been as effective . the core relationship between trevor and lanh is obviously homosexual , but surrender dorothy isn't a "" gay film . "" the real focus of dinovis' picture is on trevor's obsession . it's frightening to consider the kind of monster that can lurk within the psyche of someone as apparently-ineffectual as trevor . surrender dorothy can also be seen as an autopsy of a universal problem : domestic abuse . trevor is the abuser and lanh is the victim , and , although their roles are nontraditional , the patterns are familiar . the lead actors both give fine performances . peter pryor is completely believable as trevor , the kind of meek person we see every day on the street and in shops , but rarely notice . even more impressive is kevin dinovis , who shows great courage by placing himself in such a controversial role . apparently , dinovis wasn't his own first choice for lanh , but , when the actor originally cast in the part backed out at the last minute , dinovis had no choice if he wanted to make the film . the results are a testament to the sometimes-fortunate twists of fate on an independent movie shoot . dinovis is the perfect lanh/dorothy . surrender dorothy is part dark comedy and part ( david ) lynch- inspired melodrama , although it doesn't fit neatly into either category . it's an assault on political correctness and middle class values , but the underlying message is too urgent to disregard . ultimately , surrender dorothy isn't easy to like ( in much the same way that something in the nature of blue velvet isn't easy to like ) , but it is undeniably powerful . a week after i saw surrender dorothy , it still lingers in my consciousness while movies viewed in the interim have already faded .

"although bernardo bertolucci's besieged doesn't fit into any standard genre , perhaps that's the closest way to peg it . it is a romance , albeit a highly tentative one , and it's based on a mystery , although one that's transparently obvious . as a film overflowing with music and containing almost no dialog , it might be considered a musical , although the leads in this 2-person drama don't sing . this surprising image only a few minutes into the film leads us to believe that the picture may go for maximum shock , but , quite the contrary , the film is so placid it will likely be sleep inducing for those who don't like its purposely oblique storytelling . with its strong sense of place and the importance it places on visual narration , the picture has the effect of a haunting trance . the only recent picture that comes close in tone to it is three seasons , which is slightly better . david thewlis , best known for avant-garde work under director mike leigh's tutelage , plays mr . kinsky in a performance that keeps his emotions in complete check , save a couple of scenes . the audience can figure out what is happening immediately , perhaps even before it happens . this is all of no consequence . one can either enjoy the movie for its music and images , or one can't enjoy it at all . the african folk melodies and songs are interspersed with lush piano sonatas . every few minutes someone says something briefly , and then the music resumes . the camerawork and editing are other joys or distractions , depending on your inclination . points are emphasized , not in words , but by jump cuts , fast zooms , and slow motion . a peaceful and beautiful picture , it does have its flaws . one would expect the movie to burst with sexual tension , but , with a couple of exceptions , bertolucci seems oblivious to the possibilities . the other problem with the movie is its length . it would have made a perfect 30-minute short film , but , as a full-length motion picture , it feels stretched almost to the breaking point . the film is in english with some dialog in italian with english subtitles . it is rated r for brief nudity and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers .",0.7

"" i assume that the hope is that craven's name on the marquee will get some viewers into a film that no one would otherwise see . but the djinn always uses the nastiest interpretation of any ambiguous wish . sadly , wishmaster rarely attains the level of badness necessary for it to be enjoyable , although there are times when it can be a hoot to watch some of what passes for acting . lead actress tammy lauren gives a listless , lackluster performance that has us actively wishing for her character's death . director robert kurtzman , who has spent most of his career working as a makeup effects man ( for such films as spawn , scream , and pulp fiction ) , displays the kind of heavy-handedness that should immediately invalidate him for another shot at helming a major feature film . as a matter of personal policy , i never walk out on a movie , but that doesn't mean that i don't occasionally toy with the thought . in the course of an especially bad film , the seductive lure of getting up and heading for the exit can be almost overpowering . during wishmaster , that sensation began creeping up on me only a half-hour into the movie . i stayed to the bitter end , but it was a struggle . my best advice to anyone reading this review -- even someone who considers himself or herself a fan of horror movies -- is to stay away . that way , you won't have to wish that you had never coughed up the money in the first place .

"not since robert altman's the player has a film been this relentless in its satirical attack . the great white hype takes the boxing industry and rips it open , displaying the rotting , putrid innards for all to see . there are times when this movie is so vicious that it ceases to be funny . while the great white hype has its share of comical , occasionally-hilarious moments , don't expect a non-stop laughfest on par with this is spinal tap . co-writer ron shelton is no stranger to sports movies -- he scripted five before this ( three of which he directed ) : the best of times , bull durham , white men can't jump , cobb , and blue chips . shelton is familiar with the behind-the-scenes machinations , and this knowlege is crucial to the film's success . the great white hype works primarily because its excesses aren't far removed from reality . perhaps the most disturbing thing about the movie is the recognition of how true-to-life the most outlandish and absurd aspects are . that's the question roper's would-be-rival-in-the-ring , marvin shabazz ( michael jace ) would like answered . the pay-per-view revenue for roper's last fight is down -- way down . the money isn't rolling in the way it used to , and sultan knows the reason . they need a white hero -- someone with a "" clean-cut "" , "" all- american "" image . and , sultan adds , if he doesn't exist , "" i'll create him . "" and , although jackson's performance is the one to watch , everyone else is more than capable , especially damon wayans , who finds the right balance between seriousness and comedy . ably directed by reginald hudlin ( boomerang ) , the great white hype never lets up with its pummeling of the boxing industry and its image- obsessed attitudes . the film also presents a timely message about how racial divisiveness can be exploited in sports ( especially boxing ) to bring in big bucks . shelton and tony hendra's script sparkles with nasty , incisive wit -- their pens were sharpened to finely-honed points before they began this skewering . and the boxing match at the end is actually suspenseful , because we don't know how things are going to turn out -- there's potential for more ridicule no matter who wins or loses . there are occasions when the great white hype goes too far , and rarer instances when it doesn't go far enough , but those moments are only apparent upon close examination . this movie isn't the unqualified success that the player or spinal tap were -- both of those films had more artistry than is evident here -- but the great white hype is still the kind of first-rate satire that would make jonathan swift proud . by the time this hyper-energetic , unapologetically politically incorrect motion picture draws to a close , boxing has been dealt a knock-out punch .",0.8
"it's been more than fifteen years since the release of john carpenter's halloween , and ten since wes craven's a nightmare on elm street arrived on the big screen . each , in its own way , was a top-of- the-line horror flick--a film that relied more on chills and thrills than on graphic displays of butchery . those movies had unique visions of what was required to scare an audience , and neither resorted to the pointless and grotesque displays of gratuitous gore that permeated the other "" big "" entry of the time ( friday the 13th ) . but then came the inevitable sequels , and the corresponding plummet in quality . making a cheap buck took precedence over everything--including telling a good story . halloween 2 was steeped in blood . nightmare 2 , not directed by wes craven , lacked even a coherent story . by the end of the '80s , it was difficult to discern much difference between the various screen bogeymen : jason , michael , and freddy . it was still gore-happy , but its baddie , freddy , had a self-deprecating sense of humor ( his one-liners reminded one of the kinds of things that arnold schwarzenegger was wont to spout ) . by the fifth nightmare sequel , the films had become self- parodies . so why do another nightmare movie ? probably , as new line cinema exec robert shaye puts it ( in a cameo in this new entry ) , because the public wants it . the freddy krueger mask is still a pretty hot seller in halloween costume stores . perhaps the best turn of events is the return of wes craven , directing a nightmare for the first time since the original . he has returned a sense of genuine horror to the series , in part by taking it to completely new ground , and in part by giving his actors a legitimate script to work with . for his part , craven ( who also appears in the film ) is writing a new script ( which turns out to be the screenplay for this picture ) . those who can accept the basic premise are likely to have nearly as much fun . this isn't quite cinema verite , but at its most clever , it comes close--a sort of big-budget , horror version of my life's in turnaround . the only argument against craven's vision is that he perhaps didn't push the envelope far enough . the visual and gore effects , while not ilm top-of- the-line , are believable and occasionally downright chilling . the entire production is steeped in an unsettling atmosphere . the cinematic horror genre , like the science fiction one , has been badly hamstrung by poor films , and several of the nightmare on elm street entries have been at the forefront of the decline . therefore , it's somewhat ironic that one of the most intelligent and creative efforts to come along in a while bears the nightmare theme , title , and signature villain . any copycat features spawned by this movie will hopefully take a cue from wes craven's new nightmare and favor quality of scares over quantity of blood .",0.7
"director : richard rush . director richard rush made his last film in 1980 , a sly thriller called the stunt man which was one of the year's critical favorites . and it looks like he may have to wait another fifteen years before anyone * lets * him direct again . soon , however , it appears that capa may also be the target of intended foul play . if it were not for my personal code of ethics , i would reveal every plot twist in color of night , since they are probably the only thing which will keep anyone watching until the bitter end . on the other hand , i'm not even sure it's necessary . color of night is so sledgehammer-subtle that it would surprise me if anyone couldn't figure out the identity of the killer in the first scene in which the individual appears . sadly , it's just one of the many ways they treat the audience like it's made up of morons . in one sequence , the killer uses a car to push another car off the top level of a parking garage , endowed with a supernatural foreknowledge of exactly where willis is going to be walking below . then there are more basic matters of stupidity , such as the condition from which the film takes its title , willis' inability to see red after the death of his patient . it has absolutely no bearing on the story , is sloppily presented through occasional perspective shots , and is just another example of the offensively simplistic psychology employed by the screenwriters . the main question is whether the true criminals are the writers or the actors . but who was the most abysmal ? the whole bunch should have their sag privileges suspended . color of night was the subject of a much-publicized battle with the mpaa over explicit sex scenes which threatened to earn it an nc-17 rating , but don't be duped . color of night is about as sexy as a lump of cold mashed potatoes , and less aesthetically pleasing . it's also extremely violent , particularly in the last fifteen minutes which includes some intensely unpleasant business with a nail gun . in 1980 richard rush clearly knew how to make a good movie . i guess directing isn't exactly like riding a bike . or in this case , like driving a garbage truck .",0

"the trouble with carlyle's part ( not his performance ) was that it had no punch to it , he couldn't make it an interesting role . the stories he told about the english bringing fleas and the damp to ireland , didn't evoke the comedy or sympathy for him that it should have . the whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery and poverty , as the family will undergo a series of hardships , including the loss of three young children . the film never gets untracked from its maudlin attitude . it suffers from the old problem of trying to portray misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable itself . the other problem is that the misery seemed unreal , everything about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine . the film was flat . it was hard to care about what was happening to them , except the obvious reaction one gets when seeing a poor household . their endless plight seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end . it was the filmmakers job , the director alan parker , along with the screenwriter , laura jones , to make me want to care , but instead , they made me feel too distant to honestly feel anything . and if misery per se were an interesting topic , this adaptation of frank mccourt's book might be too . to make matters even worse , this is an excrutiatingly long film , over two-and-a-half-hour running time , and it seemed to go on forever . this almost solemn film portrayal , with an irish brogue voiceover throughout its entirety , explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work of sublime art , did not work for me . the film has a bored look about it , indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross events and that frank , as a survivor , will somehow come through all this misery . it almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight , but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the pulitzer prize winning autobiography was supposed to be ( i didn't read it ) , it was , nevertheless , made into a conventional film with nothing in it to really rave about . most life stories do not make for good dramatics in films anyway , they seem better suited for the printed page . this one is no exception .",0.3
"in an era of rapid technological change , the film industry stands out as a veritable dinosaur . so it is all the more noteworthy when a film like disney's dinosaur makes such a stunning visual achievement through radical blending of technologies . combining some of the most sophisticated computer-generated animation that you've ever seen with ( digitally enhanced ) live-action backgrounds , the ground-breaking film becomes a dinosaur documentary on steroids . it is the sort of picture that has you sitting there going , "" wow ! "" what are sorely absent , however , are pixar and their band of merry men to craft a script that can hold your attention . the result is a story that is a pale imitation of the land before time , which had more endearing characters and more effective humor . still , it's not that the script bombs , but that it fizzles . there are several nice sections of dialog , and some imaginative characterizations . but when a disney film leaves one nostalgic for the land before time , that's not a good sign . the way to approach dinosaur , however , isn't to ponder how good it could and should have been , but to enjoy what it does best , which is to recreate the world of the dinosaurs toward the end of their reign on earth . best of all is the realism shown in the skin of the dinosaurs , which has a texture so life-life , that you'll swear they've located real dinosaur flesh and digitally imposed it on computer generated wire-frames . this magic extends to all of the textures including those of the dinosaur's comical sidekicks , a group of lemurs , whose fur can be seen convincingly blowing in the breeze as the lemurs leap from tree to tree . "" things like that eat things like us for snacks , "" he admonishes them . "" this monster's got no teeth , "" zini points out . scariest of all are some chillingly realistic carnotaurs , which look like t-rexs , who roar a lot and eat everything in sight . this brings us to the issue of the film's rating . disney's animated motion pictures are almost always rated g . in order to make the movie as authentic as possible , disney allowed the filmmakers to bring dinosaurs in at a pg rating . but it is an extremely intense pg that has significant potential to scare little ones . these carnotaurs would have been happy to nosh on little humans , something that the small fry will easily be able to imagine . and when the meteors hit , it may look like the end of the world to impressionable youngsters . the rest of the storyline follows a formula so cast in stone that it could have been written by a computer . maybe it was . the movie's press kit proudly brags about what a technical tour de force it is . and rightly so . since software designers use the word "" dinosaur "" as a derogatory term , the irony of this claim has a delicious charm to it . although one can argue whether knowing the amount of code means anything , it did bring to mind the technical genius that went into the production of dinosaur . even if the film has shortcomings , its visuals are nothing short of incredible . it is rated pg for intense images and would be fine for kids around 8 and up . parents with kids who frighten easily should carefully consider whether their children are ready for this picture . my son jeffrey , age 11 , loved the movie , giving it a full * * * * . he particularly liked the computer generated animation . he said that he enjoyed it when the movie scared him a little bit .",0.7

"the two main characters in neil labute's in the company of men -- the best american film to appear this year , and the best film _likely_ to appear -- do some of the most vicious things screen characters have ever done without weapons . you may walk into in the company of men expecting it to be about the cruelty of men towards women . you'll walk out realizing it is about cruelty in every possible permutation . it is a testimony to labute's talent as a storyteller that he allows us to see the damaged humanity beneath the despicable things his characters do . matt malloy's howard , who seems to be the kinder of the two , simply has a more benign pathology . then there is chad , a startling creation rendered with creepy nonchalance and savage humor by aaron eckhart . it would be easy to read chad as a simple sociopath ; it would also be the least interesting reading . his every action is a pre-emptive first strike of rage -- at women , at his co-workers , at the world -- designed to keep everyone off-balance through the bald-faced exertion of power . labute employs notably static composition throughout in the company of men , the kind which might be written off as the work of a rookie film-maker who hasn't discovered his visual style . i can't imagine a more fitting style for this story . for all their barely-diluted bile , chad and howard are essentially creations of their world , a corporate culture of claustrophobic cubicles , water cooler back-stabbing and mundane line-ups at the copy machine . labute's shots cage his performers , observing their panicked movements from a distance as though they were zoo animals . there is no room for morality in the company of men ; the concept is a luxury for those who still feel human . in the company of men is caustic enough that it's not always a pleasant experience , but it's hardly like taking medicine , either . labute's brilliant script and eckhart's star-making performance as chad create some of the year's most hilarious moments , even if the laughter is born of disbelief as frequently as delight . in fact , chad is so charming that there is bound to be consternation over his portrayal , concern that he could be viewed as a cutthroat role model . how sad if there were even a glimmer of truth to such perceptions . neil labute has unveiled the horror of an environment of gross selfishness turned toxic -- it's objectivism rendered as psychosis . watching in the company of men is like watching a car wreck between ethics and primal urges , one from which it's almost impossible to look away . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",1
"when one thinks of scandinavian movies , the name of ingmar bergman leaps to mind . the great swedish director's films were almost always austere , beautifully-made , and intellectual ( sometimes to a fault ) . as a result , those whose expectations for junk mail are based on bergman , are in for something of a shock . this movie , the product of norwegian first-time director pal sletaune , owes more to david lynch and denmark's the kingdom than it does to the work of bergman , troell , or any other notable scandinavian film maker . most of the film takes place in the seed , dirty , and dreary backrooms and alleys of oslo , and the characters are like rejects from terry gilliam's brazil . and , although junk mail threads its way through a series of potentially-serious issues , sletaune keeps the tone comical ( albeit darkly so ) . in many ways , this is a strange movie ; i liked it in spite of the characters , who could charitably be called unpleasant losers , and in spite of the grungy atmosphere , which seems to have soaked into the bones of everyone populating the picture . junk mail generated an incredibly strong buzz at last year's toronto film festival ( where i had originally planned to see it ) . instead of faithfully delivering parcels and envelopes to their rightful destinations ( see kevin costner's the postman if you want this kind of mentality ) , he dumps about half of his load so he can spend hours loafing . not surprisingly , the standout performance in junk mail belongs to robert skjaerstad , who manages to make a worm like roy seem believable . >from time-to-time , we actually find ourselves feeling something close to sympathy for him . andrine saether is pleasant as line . per egil aske plays georg as a cross between a conscienceless sociopath and a bumbling idiot . he's deadly , but a little too stupid to be truly frightening . this edgy , entirely original movie succeeds for a couple of reasons : it isn't afraid of breaking the rules ( the lead character is a pathetic loser who never finds redemption ) and it never overexplains itself to the audience . it's a fresh , quirky picture that will appeal to anyone looking for something that , as monty python put it , is completely different . the only real downside is that the conclusion is a little too open-ended to be fully satisfying . up to that point , however , junk mail is an entertainingly offbeat experience . it's unclear whether this will get any kind of widespread u . s . distribution , but it has already become , and will likely continue to be , a film festival favorite .

"screenplay : david s . goyer . director : tim pope . the advertising campaign for the crow : city of angels invites us to "" believe in the power of another , "" but it sounds more like a plea for sympathy . after all , what are you supposed to do when you want to make a sequel but the star of the first film is no longer with us ? well , i suppose the obvious answer -- swallow your checkbook and allow the crow to rest in peace -- was unacceptable , but this is one sequel which seemed utterly doomed from the first minute . 1994's the crow was a film with a striking look , but it owed virtually every ounce of emotional resonance it had to the tragic death of star brandon lee while filming the scene in which his character is killed . city of angels has no such back story to prop up its re-tread of the first film , and seems determined to substitute excess for emotion in what has to rank as one of the year's most grueling cinematic ordeals . if there is anyone you should really feel sorry for in this mess , it is vincent perez , because i don't think he ever had a chance . this isn't like val kilmer stepping into batman's boots , or pierce brosnan taking over as 007 ; it's more like someone trying to replace patrick stewart as captain picard . perez has the right look for the part -- he looks serviceably eerie in the crow's face paint and leather duster -- but he's not brandon lee . that's not even a criticism , because i'm not convinced lee was anything that special . the point is that those who come to this film because they loved the crow are going to have a real problem with this guy with a french accent taking over for their hero . then again , i suppose perez always could have said no , especially once he got a look at a script which has him making his entrance emerging from a fountain of water in tattered clothes looking like esther williams on the way to a rave . there is plenty of silliness like that in city of angels ( it tries to stake a claim to mytho-poetic status by including a tiresias-like blind seer ) , but mostly it is an empty recycling of the crow . it's a resolutely ugly film director tim pope has put together , heavy on gratuitous s&m but light on any semblance of a point . sarah ( we assume this is the skate-punk from the first film all grown up ) serves only to give us the lovely mia kirshner to look at , and pope appears far more concerned with serving up candle-wax-on-the-nipples than creating characters . there are plenty of individual reasons to avoid city of angels ( though iggy pop makes an ideal villain for the crow since he looks like a corpse himself ) , but it's much simpler to explain why each category of potential viewer should stay away . if you did not see the first film , you probably have no interest in a dark story of vengeance with plenty of unpleasantness . if you saw the first film and did not like it , expect more of the same in city of angels , only less compelling , less artistic and more obsessed with music video theatrics . and if you saw the first film and _did_ like it , do the memory of brandon lee a great honor and do not let his death provide a producer with an excuse to build a franchise this awful on his grave .",0.2

"" nevertheless , troche and turner have achieved their aim--go fish is the most enjoyable and entertaining gay/lesbian film to come along in a few years . it is heartfelt , able and willing to see the humor in almost any situation , and avoids a preachy or condescending tone . this is a modern romance of the sort that hollywood is afraid to touch . fortunately , there are filmmakers like troche and turner who are determined to make and distribute a go fish , no matter what obstacles stand in their way .",0.73
"for most of us , we have formed an opinion on how we think it works , even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story . it is not until we see an actual trial , do we sense how delicate a system we have , how in the hands of forthright , honest , intelligent , and fair-minded participants , the system should work fine , but if that is not so , we better watch out , the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work . and that is what this objective documentary does , as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job . for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly , the pint sized 17-year-old , who has an iq of 72 , he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner , and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates . just seeing them and hearing their story , and seeing no solid proof put forward , except for innuendo and a coerced confession , is not what i call a solid case against them . the job they did frightened the heck out of me , because of their unwillingness to check everything out , and as much as the crime revolted me , this revolted me with almost equal disdain . this is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime . jason could hardly say a word , and seems to be mortified , not really aware of what is going on , and appears to have no connection with anything occult , except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music . if ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty , this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class . it was frightening for me to watch how the process works . there is no outcry from the community about injustice , and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate , that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment , which i sincerely doubt , this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed , not only in my questioning of the verdict , but the whole process itself , and wondering if our system is so flawed , that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone , realizing how political all verdicts appear to be .",0.6

"perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up . the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .",0.3
"sincerity , in and of itself , does not a good film make . true stories , no matter how harrowing , will not guarantee that a movie made about them will become a compelling motion picture . beresford's directorial record overflows with inconsistencies . for every winner such as driving miss daisy or tender mercies , there are flops like last dance or a good man in africa . bereford's movies click when they concentrate on a few characters who have a touching story to tell and a well developed script . glenn close , playing a character remarkably like sarah wheaton from sarah , plain and tall , gives an earnest reading of a prisoner of war who essentially becomes the prisoners' leader and choirmaster . margaret gets most of the memorable , if sometimes corny , dialog .

( well , her character's job does generate the movie's most blatant product promotion . ) the negative chemistry between sam and john provides some of the show's best tension and humor . downey's acting is especially remarkable for its steely passion and total focus . although downey's character is not a comical one , he gets as many good one-liners as does jones in his leading role . but the script does suffer the problem of most of today's thrillers , delivering highly predictable and equally unnecessary twists at the end . a more straightforward chase picture would have been better . and why , oh why does the lead always feel a need to go mano a mano with the killer ? it is rated pg-13 for violence and language and would be fine for kids around ten and up .",0.7
"the idea behind synthetic pleasures is fascinating enough : examine how rapid advances in technology are changing culture and civilization . it's a rich and varied subject with more depth than even a lengthy documentary could probe . and , at 83 minutes , synthetic pleasures is not long . that doesn't stop the film from attempting to touch on such varying topics as nanotechnology , artificial intelligence , cryonics , plastic beauty , virtual reality , nootropics , cyber sex , transhumanism , biotechnology , artificial nature , and terminal identity . don't know what some of those terms mean ? well , even after seeing the movie , you probably still won't . synthetic pleasures is a shallow , rapid- fire survey , not an in-depth essay . there's a direct relationship between your ignorance of the material and how much you'll get out of the film . computer-literate , technologically-minded individuals are likely to find much of synthetic pleasures insubstantial and trite . for those of us who are "" in the know "" ( hence , most likely to be attracted by the premise ) , the film doesn't offer any revelations . it rehashes things that we've read about or experienced . on the other hand , those who don't understand how to set the clocks on their vcrs may be in for an eye-opening experience . it's hard not to applaud director iara lee's intentions , even if the results are less-than-satisfying . there's at least enough here to spur a lengthy post-film discussion . unfortunately , any such interaction is likely to be more compelling than the movie itself . one of the most distressing aspects of synthetic pleasures is that when it raises a truly thought-provoking issue , instead of staying with it , the film rushes on . synthetic pleasures asks a lot of questions . will increasing reliance upon computers add to the already-pervasive sense of alienation ? does a controlled life make for a better life , or does the unexpected make life worth living ? however , not only are none of these questions answered , the film doesn't offer much of an opinion about them . we get occasional sound bytes from talking head experts , but that's all . the film mentions so many issues that it can't help piquing everyone's curiosity at some point . for example , if you're wondering how close we are to the implant devices of strange days or the holodeck of star trek , synthetic pleasures has something to say . visually , the film is unspectacular . consisting mainly of crude computer animation , synthetic pleasures' look rapidly grows tedious . since most of the information comes through a series of short interviews and the voiceover narration , it's possible to close your eyes and not miss much . for a movie that's about cutting-edge technology , it's ironic ( although not surprising , considering the small budget lee had ) that the presentation is so technically limited . essentially , synthetic pleasures is an mtv-style documentary . when it comes to subject breadth , the movie is in good shape , but at no time does it attempt anything more ambitious than skimming the surface . unfortunately , it's underneath , beyond synthetic pleasures' scope , where the really good stuff lies .",0.6

"bad behaviour could easily be called a few days in the life of gerry and ellie mcallister if that title was commercially viable . reminiscent in tone , if not content , to mike leigh's life is sweet , bad behaviour can ( perhaps unfairly ) be pigeonholed into the "" slice of life "" motion picture category . the film really doesn't go anywhere , but the audience experiences an easygoing , amiable ride along the way . when all is said and done , little happens in this movie except that we've gotten to know a few interesting and witty characters . nevertheless , it's highly unlikely that anyone will feel cheated . at first i thought stephen rea was giving a rather lackluster performance , but continuing exposure to his gerry brought a revelation : rea had immersed himself so completely in the role that what i was reacting to was gerry himself - a stodgy , rather uninspiring sort of individual . likewise , sinead cusack dons her part with considerable flair . most of the humor in bad behaviour is dry , but there are a few instances likely to spark laughter ( most of which involve howard or the nunn brothers ) . as is usually the case in the best examples of these sorts of films , there's an element of poignancy present , but it's neither maudlin enough to sidetrack the production , nor overt enough to lead to straight melodrama . everything is kept in the proper proportion , leading to an energetic , entertaining movie-going experience . perhaps as interesting as the movie itself is the story of how it was brought into being , and how the characters came to be developed . if the writing credit above looks a little odd , it's because director les blair relied as much upon his cast as himself to develop gerry , ellie , and friends . bad behaviour comes close to being an improvisational motion picture . from there , the writer/director developed a 25-page script that described the storyline , but contained no dialogue ( the characters' lines were developed during the rehearsals ) . bad behaviour is an intelligent , insightful film that suffers only from uneven pacing and an occasional tendency to be too "" talky "" . once it gets going , the movie is intensely fascinating , but it takes nearly half the running length before the audience begins to get a real feel for the characters and situations . bad behaviour's strengths are much more apparent than its weaknesses , however , and it's worth a trip to a theater .",0.69

"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest . the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . there is comedy and tragedy . it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased . it's the ceremony that they're interested in . the acting is strong and believable . there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

"love , passion , and irish catholicism collide in the brothers mcmullen , writer/director edward burns' feature debut . this is one of the better independent romantic comedies to come along in a while . although it generally stays true to the cliches and plot turns of the genre , the brothers mcmullen is smart and honest rather than manipulative . instead of resorting to hard-to-swallow story complications , this film stays on-target from its opening moments . along the way , the empty dialogue too often incipient in this sort of picture is replaced by intelligent , insightful conversations . but is this a genuine concern , or just an excuse to avoid commitment ? if this film was only about the three men and their relationships , it would be enjoyable , but not particularly noteworthy . in fact , in the brothers mcmullen , the female halves of the relationships are often smarter and hipper than their male counterparts . despite its occasional forays into weighty matters , the brothers mcmullen largely stays on the light side , where all good romantic comedies reside . the tone is upbeat and the script is laced with wit and , upon occasion , there are moments guaranteed to cause deeper , louder laughter . barry's comparison of relationships to peeling and slicing a banana is the movie's comic highlight . above all , the brothers mcmullen is undeniably charming , and that's the best reason to spend ninety-seven minutes with these men . you don't have to be catholic , or irish , or even american , to "" get it .

"i love trouble is a perfect example of a truly lightweight motion picture . with its preposterous plot and mtv-like camerawork , this movie survives--and occasionally even thrives--on the likeability of its performers and the unexpectedly frothy chemistry between them . this is a watchable film for those who don't expect or demand much from their summer entertainment . taking this film at face value , one might be tempted to say that the mystery elements are merely plot devices around which to build the peterson/brackett relationship . this certainly seems to be the case early on . however , somewhere along the way , screenwriters meyers and shyer apparently decided that they had the makings of a decent thriller on their hands . as a result , far too much time is spent expanding upon an element of the plot that makes very little sense and has almost no audience appeal . i love trouble ends up being about 30 minutes too long . the last half-hour especially drags , as the interaction between brackett and peterson is curtailed in favor of shoot-outs , chases , and a lot of idiotic exposition . we have yet another example of a villain holding a hero at gunpoint and gleefully explaining his entire crime . when i love trouble is focusing on the interplay between nolte and roberts , it's generally enjoyable , despite some atrocious dialogue . a lot of the so-called "" witty repartee "" between the two principals ends up sounding horribly contrived . they're like bogart and becall or tracy and hepburn sparring with each other good-naturedly , sexual tension crackling between them . stick a pair of mismatched , marginal performers in the roles of brackett and peterson , and i love trouble might have been very , very bad . nolte rarely gives a subpar performance , and this is no exception as he lends the full force of his not inconsiderable talent into playing brackett . julia roberts generally does her best work in lighter roles ( even though it has elements of a thriller/mystery , i love trouble is , at heart , a romantic comedy ) , and her peterson proves an apt foil for brackett . the pair work well together , regardless of what they're doing or saying , and it's a credit to them both that they're able to overcome so many of the script's faults and still keep the audience interested . alas , screen charisma and chemistry can only get you so far , and that's the problem with this sort of film . the dubious premise is not well-executed , and the final product too often emphasizes its weaknesses rather than its strengths . the sad truth is that whenever i love trouble relies on something other than its two stars , it's in trouble .",0.54

"malice is a well-crafted , intelligently-scripted thriller that is perhaps a bit too slick to be considered film noire , but is nevertheless hitchcockian in intent . the movie breaks free of the mold that so many of its genre have lately fallen into , that of a seemingly-helpful friend/neighbor/nanny/police officer/whatever turning out to be a wacko . malice has a little more class than that . there are quite a few twists and turns in the plot , some of which aren't that difficult to figure out , but a few that are likely to take the viewer unawares . make no mistake : the intent of this movie is to surprise the audience , and it succeeds fairly well at that . while it's true that in the aftermath of malice , careful thought will reveal some logical flaws in the script , these aren't nearly as noticeable during the action . the plot has some structural problems resulting from trying to do a bit too much for the running time . there are also several scenes and plot threads that , while interesting , ultimately have nothing to do with the story . the inclusion of these is more odd than frustrating , however . the unusual genesis of the script might have something to do with the irrelevance of some of what appears . this was before a few good men had made the transition from play to film . so , although the shooting script came from sorkin's pen , it included numerous elements of both his own and frank's versions . considering the number of cooks involved in this broth , it's amazing that the final product is so polished . scott frank's involvement immediately makes one think of dead again , but this movie is closer to shattered in execution--the plot twists aren't nearly as well-camouflaged as in the kenneth branagh-directed thriller . that is only one of a few standout scenes , all but one of which feature baldwin . the acting is uniformly good , with appearances by anne bancroft ( who is wonderful ) and george c . scott ( who is solid , but nothing to write home about ) . baldwin loves this kind of role , and nicole kidman shows that she's capable of being more than tom cruise's on- and off-screen love interest . bill pullman is the weakest of the trio , but he gets better as the film progresses . jerry goldsmith turns in a surprisingly spare score , more reminiscent of bernard hermann's hitchcock material than his own overblown basic instinct music . it's a pleasure not to be bombarded by blasts of music any time something dramatic is about to happen . goldsmith deserves credit for this . there are movies that demand loud , bombastic themes , but this is not one of them , and the composer recognized this . occasionally there's a diamond in the rough like dead again , but mostly these films are dreary , predictable , and utterly uninteresting--entirely the opposite of what the word "" thriller "" means . while malice won't win any awards , it's a cut above the average . yes , there are hollywood conventions in it , but the movie also keeps the intelligent viewer in mind . while the final result is something of a curious mixture , it's ultimately one that provides a source of entertainment .",0.69
"alfred hitchcock used the term "" refrigerator movie "" to describe certain films . david fincher's the game is an obvious member of this class of motion pictures . as it's unspooling on screen , the film is hugely entertaining , but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated . this is michael douglas' movie . sean penn and deborah kara unger , who receive second and third billing , respectively , are supporting performers in the truest sense of the word , since neither has more than fifteen to thirty minutes of screen time . he's in nearly every scene , and the film is told from his character's point-of-view . and nicholas van orten is the kind of man that douglas plays best -- initially cool and reserved , then gradually less and less sure of himself and his circumstances . the actor's intensity in his approach to this character is palpable . beyond making obtuse statements like it's "" an experiential book-of-the-month club , "" no one is willing or able to describe the game in any detail to nick . at one point or another , the game reminded me of three past movies : the laurence olivier/michael caine classic , sleuth ; martin scorsese's wildly offbeat after hours ; and the improbable-but-fun malice . all three of those films had the same sense of unpredictability evident in the game ( although , to be fair , sleuth and after hours were superior ; malice wasn't quite as tightly-scripted ) . the one complaint that i have about this picture's many turns is that they don't always play fair with the audience . the screenplay was written with the primary intention of surprising viewers without much consideration for the practicality or logic of the twists . there are red herrings everywhere , but , unlike in the best-constructed mysteries , a few too many of them are superfluous and transparent . director david fincher creates the same kind of dark , brooding feel that he developed for both of his previous features , alien 3 and seven . the atmosphere is thick and heavy , and there are times when , coupled with fincher's crisp direction , it effectively distracts us from thinking too deeply about the plot . figuring out all the ins and outs of the game is like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle . we struggle alongside nick to determine what's really going on , and , just when we think we have it , something happens to make us doubt our conclusion . the script has its clever moments , and it's easy to mistake this for a smart movie . however , that intelligence is only surface-deep -- the seams in the plot are quite visible if you look hard enough . nevertheless , for anyone who is willing to suspend their disbelief ( which , admittedly , isn't all that hard to do ) , the game offers the kind of taut , unpredictable ride that hitchcock would have approved of .

"here , as in the 1972 gangster saga , the significance of family is a central issue , although each movie chooses to explore this differently . although vastly different from the godfather , to live is also echoed by my family . here , the setting is different , but the message is the same . my family never shrinks from tragedy , but it doesn't wallow in it , either . one highlighted truth is the commonality of the human experience . though the focus is one specific family , every issue confronted by the characters is universal . as is true in all good "" ethnic "" motion pictures , the central culture provides a rich and resonant backdrop to stories capable of touching anyone , regardless of heritage or upbringing . certain emotions , beliefs , and hopes cross racial lines , and it is through these that my family finds its strength . the third era is the longest and most detailed , but valuable background is presented in the other two . my family requires the totality of its story for the climactic moments to attain their full dramatic impact , especially since writer/director gregory nava ( el norte ) refuses cheap , theatrical methods of audience manipulation . as the emotional fulcrum of my family , he is consistent , with no evidence of over- or underacting . edward james olmos as paco , one of six sanchez children , is the narrator ( i could have done without the lengthy and intrusive voiceovers ) . my family constantly builds upon itself . each scene has meaning not only because of what comes before it , but for what it adds to all that comes after . the film runs the audience through a range of emotions from laughter to tears , but the tone retains a sense of hopefulness . my family is amazingly rich , with themes that are topical-yet- timeless , a solidly-constructed story to give them vitality , and superlative production values . cinematographer edward lachman has photographed all three eras differently , and his visual flair adds another layer to this production . my family gives us culture shock and class distinctions , metaphors involving owls and bridges , and the struggle between traditional values and modern ethics . above all , however , it is faithful to its title , presenting the newest portrait of an ancient truth--of all the ties that bind humans to each other , none is more lasting than that of birth and blood .",0.87
"movies about mormon missionaries might seem likely to get the same reaction from non-believers . in the case of god's army , viewers who shut the cinematic equivalent of the door in its face will be depriving themselves of a surprisingly good film about faith and dedication . like a high quality blend of a documentary and an after-school television special , this low-budget , fictional film creates a host of interesting characters and provides a lot of surprising background on what it means to be a mormon missionary . although you may have never given them a second thought , they don't have an easy vocation .

"" belle epoque , the winner of nine goyas ( spanish oscars ) , is a charming motion picture that requires only enough thought and concentration to read the subtitles . as a diversion , the film is fabulous . how it managed to win the best foreign language film oscar ( especially over a contender like farewell my concubine ) is another matter altogether . it is 1931 . some of issues presented by the tumultuous political climate and the churning waters of religious uncertainty keep belle epoque from being a completely brainless endeavor . nevertheless , anything serious is kept strictly in the background , and even the most dismal scenes are presented with enough playfulness to avoid betraying the giddy tone . with a minimum of nudity , belle epoque demonstrates that the blatant displays of flesh from something like sirens are unnecessary to set an atmosphere of sensuality . this is a steamy motion picture with its share of bed-hopping and partner-swapping . all six major characters are nicely-developed and well-portrayed . despite the numerous sexual trysts he engages in , fernando is still something of an innocent , and jorge sanz plays him to wide-eyed perfection . the most complex character of all is manolo , who is based on a real-life acquaintance of producer/director fernando trueba . the character's own words describe him best : "" i am a rebel , an infidel , and a libertine by nature , living life like a scared old bourgeois .

"a curious thing happened to cosi on its way to a united states release -- it got lost . or at least temporarily misplaced . miramax films began showing trailers for this movie more than a year ago , but the opening date was repeatedly delayed until just about everyone had forgotten about it . unfortunately , it's not really worth the wait . the film is like a half-baked amalgamation of a midwinter's tale and shine , and doesn't excel as either a comedy or a drama . following an audition process that isn't as funny or inventive as that from either a midwinter's tale or waiting for guffman , lewis has his cast , which is comprised of the usual suspects . while there's potential in that story , director mark joffe ( the efficiency expert ) paints everything with broad strokes . the characters are all types and their circumstances are predictable . the shallow script , adapted by louis nowra from his play , proceeds in a disappointingly straightforward fashion . because cosi's dramatic side is so weak , it's up to the comedy to sustain the film . however , while the movie delivers a few hearty laughs here and there , the humor is inconsistent . the most interesting aspect of the plot -- a subtext that asks questions about female fidelity ( the theme of cosi fan tutte ) and male double standards -- is left largely unexplored . a feeble attempt is made to address these issues as they apply to lewis' life , but the result isn't satisfying . the cast is populated by recognizable faces from australian cinema . even though he has the most screen time , his low-key performance allows him to be easily eclipsed . this tendency to fade into the background makes it difficult for us to get a handle on lewis . his overwrought turn as roy allows us to better appreciate the nuances of geoffrey rush's interpretation of david helfgott in shine . despite its numerous shortcomings , cosi contains several magical moments . another happens late in the film , as julie sings "" stand by me "" to an enraptured audience . there's also a lengthy post-credits sequence , which , in addition to offering one of the film's funniest gags , presents perhaps the strangest conclusion to a movie that i've ever witnessed . if you choose to see cosi , do not leave until the end credits are over . when it comes to filmed versions of behind-the-scenes amateur theatrical productions , cosi is a weak entry . it's a good-natured film , i suppose , but its attempts to inspire often seem more manipulative than uplifting . maybe the reason for miramax's release delay is that , recognizing how mediocre cosi is , they hoped that , like an average wine , it might improve if it was left sitting on the shelf . clearly , that hasn't happened .",0.6
"with a mostly female cast and a poetic title , it might be easy to assume that paradise road is a 1997 version of mike newell's effervescent enchanted april . however , apart from those stated similarities , there's little to connect the two films . paradise road shifts the focus to the lesser-known , but no less inhumane , conditions in the pacific . based on the memoirs of survivors , this movie peels away one more layer of the atrocities associated with the second world war . and the means that the prisoners devise to lift their spirits are , to say the least , unique . yet , even though paradise road is ultimately about the triumph over adversity , the script never forgets that for everyone who overcomes seemingly-impossible obstacles , there are many who stumble along the way , never to rise again . the exceptionally strong cast showcases american , british , and australian actresses , all of whom show an astonishing willingness to appear in physically unflattering circumstances ( no makeup , hair and skin caked with drying mud ) . paradise road is less a tearjerker than an honest examination of the bonds that are formed during extreme situations . although there are some heart-wrenching moments , and several scenes of potentially- disturbing violence , the film never descends to the level of cheap melodrama . instead , it opts for something deeper and more meaningful by allowing us to follow a group of well-rounded characters on a journey with a strong spiritual component . paradise road not only pays tribute to the human will to live , but it is a testament to music's lasting power to heal and uplift . ultimately , paradise road isn't as deeply sad or depressing as a holocaust film , for , although several characters do not survive the movie , the goal of the japanese is punishment and humiliation , not genocide . and , while one of paradise road's themes is the barbarity of war , it manages to present its case without demonizing the japanese ( indeed , it goes to great pains to paint a few of them as sympathetic ) . instead , the film succeeds by humanizing the kinds of survivors who are often pictured as wretched , faceless victims . paradise road owes its existence to writer/director bruce beresford , one of the most inconsistent film makers working today .",0.85
"in contemporary popular art , there's a very fine line between sheer brilliance and head-smacking pretentiousness . it's a line most visionary film directors flirt with on a regular basis , to the point of tying said line into the occasional sheepshank knots . it almost seems as though , for all their periodic misfires , film-makers like david lynch , terry gilliam and stanley kubrick have no choice but to take you places no one else can or will take you . you suspect that even though the film you are watching may not be great , the creative mind behind it could be . darren aronofsky's debut feature pi may not be a work of pure originality -- the echoes of lynch's eraserhead are too distinct -- but i can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year . at its core , pi is an icarus fable of a man reaching for knowledge beyond his capacity to handle it , with a side order of cyber-era isolation cautionary tale . aronofsky uses voice-over narration effectively to get us inside max's seizure-wracked head ( with superb musical assistance from clint mansell of pop will eat itself ) , showing us the world as an actualized paranoid fantasy viewed through a self-imposed cage of computers . pi might have been a frighteningly engrossing character study if only sean gullette had been able to match the intensity of the material . his steven wright-as-computer geek demeanor suggests a typical socially-challenged nerd more often than a man spinning into madness ; though he didn't need to bug out his eyes and foam at the mouth , he did need to place max close enough to the edge for us to see the bottom from there . gullette's competent but distant performance lowers the stakes of pi's twisted conspiracy theoretics . yes , he does stretch too hard at times to achieve his lynchian vibe -- grainy black-and-white photography , a mysterious sticky substance , blinding flashes of light and a brain covered with ants do not necessarily a profound statement make . but who else would construct a psychological thriller around large number theory , wall street and the kaballah ? who else would create visuals as distinct as max's techno-organic apartment , or make an audience squirm so violently at the do-not-try-this-at-home use of a certain power tool ? and who else has demonstrated the cinematic instincts to turn a scene of a man writing down numbers into something more tension-packed than a dozen hollywood chase scenes . the most obvious antecedent may be lynch , but even lynch's hypnotic images have rarely been this kinetic . though aronofsky may have been limited by finances , available talent or technical constraints , he has created a work which leaves you hungry for what he could do next . pi is the creation of that one film-maker in a hundred who seems unlikely to make movies by the numbers . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.7
"until we rented it over the holidays , i had not seen it in its entirety in a couple of decades . this part of the movie has a capraesque quality . too often child actors are no more than cute , sometimes painfully so . all three of these kids give skillful performances of real depth . it seems boo is the local bogeyman , or so all the kids believe . boo lives in a house that reminds you of the house in psycho . even if it does not look at all similar , it feels much the same . only brave kids , like tomboy scout , dare get near the porch , much less on it . do you remember who plays boo ? it is robert duvall in his first movie part . he does not speak a word and is not even seen until the end , but his role in the film is crucial . elmer bernstein's music for the film remind us of the magic and the simplicity of that time . the crickets outside will almost lull you to sleep , but knowing that danger or tragedy is just around the corner , you dare not blink an eye . there were tire swings in the front yard , and front porches with rocking chairs or swings were de rigueur . the kids in this picture have more in common with those of tom sawyer's era than today's . in a film bursting at the seams with great performances , brock peters's small role is acted with brilliance . the acting by paxton and anderson is chillingly effective as well . their performances are strong and believable without the natural tendency to overact their parts as villains . it is done with devastating force , but without the theatrics we have become to associate with trials . the secondary event happens near the end , but i can not describe it without giving it away so i will say no more . second only to the quality of the acting is the precise and lucid direction by robert mulligan and the literate and academy award winning script by horton foote , based on the book by harper lee . the entire show is a masterpiece crafted with loving care . a show that must be seen . and seen again . it is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 . there is no sex , nudity , or profanity . there are mature themes and some frightening scenes of people being chased and grabbed . the movie would probably be appropriate for kids nine or ten and up . i know it would have frightened the daylights out of my seven and a half year old had we let him watch it . i recommend the movie to you in the strongest possible terms , and i award the film a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.9
"the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of "" snow white "" , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .",0.3
"what is noteworthy about the telling of the story , is how earnest and real their situation is , and how magnificently graceful the actors are , slowly revealing the sore points and tender sides of their troubled souls . the subplots that develop connect somehow with the main characters in an effortless way . it seems whatever you do in modern alaska , you have to hurt someone or something , whether intentionally or not . the ending of the film is problematic and inconclusive , though it seems apparent that they are doomed . many viewers will be disappointed that there is no payoff in the story . the film was well served by a capable cast ; and , even if , its story bit off a lot of ground to chew , a lot more than it was capable of fully digesting ( too many topics from environmental issues to dysfunctional families ) , it was still good storytelling . but it did try to get too clever with the plot allowing every angle of the character's problems to fit too nicely together-- there was too much of a parallel symbolism of the castaways relating to their three lives that was too neat for its own good . but this is topped by thought provoking storytelling , one that was visually stunning as well as accomplished with mature dialogue . the film didn't always work , as melodramatics seemed to take away from the tremendous drive the story had on its own merits as a straight romantic tale . but what kept it compelling was the human drama , that made me want to think that the trio had found something on their journey that they didn't realize that they had before . though the unresolved ending to the film might bother some viewers , that of being in a state of limbo is not the worst way in which to end a film , especially one where the storytelling itself is the aspect of the film that veers from guarded hope to fatalism , where each of the characters is seen on this deserted island as not being able to run away from their problems anymore .",0.8

"" most of the show sticks , correctly , to the action for his laughs , and director les mayfield keeps a high energy level to the proceedings without going overboard . one subplot deals with weebo's crush on phillip . in addition to talking , she has a video screen that pops up so that she can show brief clips of old movies to illustrate her feelings . rather than tiring of this gimmick , it actually grows on you as does weebo's adorable personality . the bad guys are purely cartoonish , the type that get knocked down and then knocked down again . robin williams , flying his flubber-powered 1963 red thunderbird convertible , even runs into the tree outside the kid's bedroom . evaluated as adult level humor , flubber would have trouble measuring up . but as a kid's show , it delivers the goods with some riotously funny sequences . finally , consider this modern miracle . flubber is an outlandish kid's comedy without almost no bathroom humor . they don't make many movies like that anymore . it is rated pg for cartoon mayhem and would be fine for all ages . kerry commented on how much she laughed , and jeffrey talked about his favorite characters , weebo , flubber , and the little kid . jeffrey said he thought it was one of the best movies of the year .",0.7
"date released : undetermined ( summer 1994 ) running length : 1 : 35 rated : not yet rated ( language , mature themes , nudity ) it has been my experience that many motion pictures suffer somewhat in retrospect . the further one gets from the theater , the more flaws come to light . the passage of time allows a viewer an opportunity to consider and digest . those who do not enjoy interpreting certain film elements , and thus drawing their own conclusions , would do better to stay away from roosters . on the surface , this is a film about cock fights . this is a person who cares about one thing , and one thing only--his roosters . one of roosters' great strengths is its development of character relationships . accomplished with subtlety and insight , and just enough ambiguity to keep us wondering about certain aspects , this is by far the highlight of milcha sanchez-scotts script . symbolism abounds , both religious and secular . the rooster , representative of machismo , plays a central role of all that transpires ( as one might guess from the films title . gallo continually equates his birds with his manhood , and the willingness to fight and be bloodied with the maturation process . the climax toward which all of these build is possibly inevitable , and certainly foreshadowed , yet it is nevertheless the most powerful single moment of the motion picture . little has been resolved as the final credits roll , and it's up to the viewer to decide exactly what happened , and what will come next . if roosters has an obvious flaw , it lies in the dialogue , which is often too flowery or intellectual . the author is taking poetic license to get across her higher meaning , but on more than one occasion , a line is jarringly inappropriate for the speaker or the circumstances in which it is spoken . the principal actors all do fine jobs , but the performance of newcomer sarah lassez is a standout . when she is on screen , she transfixes the audience with her blend of innocence and sensuality . roosters delves into latino traditions to uncover universal themes . adapted from a play , with an expectedly slow pace for a story making that transition , this movie holds the attention of its audience by its depth of meaning and richness of characters . roosters is not effortless entertainment , but it will reward those willing to absorb what it has to say , and the manner in which it says it .",0.8
"there's slim pickings in this shamelessly contrived melodrama built around a wal-mart setting . all the contrived sitcom scenes just never click . it's a film about a vulnerable , low-class , and stupid woman , but a woman who is good-hearted . the result is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by its conclusion , whose heart lies where the schmaltz is . the film appears to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its generosity to its trailer park clientele . novalee will almost blow her chance of real love , by thinking she's not smart enough for forney . but , wouldn't you know it , there's a happy ending , as novalee finally makes a smart decision and marries forney . this is a film that got itself stuck inside wal-mart and could never get out of aisle 5 . director williams , he once directed the roseanne tv show , uses the material adapted from billie letts' best-selling novel to keep everything as dumb as he can .",0.2
"it's probably unfair to characterize the phantom as a batman- wannabe , since lee falk's comic book creation predated the caped crusader . nevertheless , as far as motion picture adaptations are concerned , michael keaton first stepped into his suit seven years before paramount pictures released this movie . and , since both superheroes lack recognizable super powers and wear costumes , the connection is obvious . it should be noted , however , that while batman's form-fitting suit looks a lot more stylish than the phantom's cheesy purple outfit , appearance isn't everything -- this film is more fun than tim burton's 1989 atmosphere-soaked , empty-headed yarn . that's not to say that the phantom , directed by simon wincer ( free willy ) , doesn't have atmosphere . actually , it's a nice-looking motion picture , with splashy colors highlighting nearly every scene . but , unlike batman , it doesn't hang everything on mood , and the tone isn't relentlessly downbeat . since the phantom never takes anything seriously , the audience doesn't have to , either . this is the sort of tongue-in-cheek campiness that knows exactly what it is , and the irreverent tone saves this film from being another failed raiders of the lost ark . in fact , the action sequences are among the least enjoyable parts of the phantom , since they're uniformly routine . if you want action , see the rock . this film is for those who enjoy come-to-life comic books with self-consciously preposterous dialogue , over-the-top acting , silly plot contrivances , and a superhero who strikes all the right poses . it's not great cinema , but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable in a b-movie way ( and , unlike most films out there now , it's entirely suitable for children ) . because all the phantoms wear the same costume , the outside world believes that there's only one of them -- an immortal vigilante of sorts -- and kit is in no hurry to dispel the illusion . zane adopts the right self-deprecating tone and has a well-toned body that fills out the skin-tight costume impressively . he seems to be enjoying himself , which is important for this sort of part . kristy swanson ( buffy the vampire slayer ) slides into the love interest role with gusto , showing enough spunk to avoid fading into the background . the villains are treat williams , who has as much fun here as jack nicholson did in batman , and james remar . although the phantom is more often enjoyable than not , it lacks that special characteristic necessary to provide it with a unique identity . arriving in the midst of so many "" can't miss "" offerings , i expect it to sink like a rock , moving quickly to "" dollar theaters "" then to video . i'd like to be able to champion this film , but the truth is that i'm tiring of the genre as a whole , and , while the phantom opts for a different tone than most of its brethren , it's still not an especially memorable motion picture . this is the kind of movie that offers modest entertainment while you're in the theater , but is forgotten by the time you get home .",0.65
"imagine the sexy jennifer lopez almost bursting out of her expensive suit and you nestled up right next to her . that's just the wonderful predicament that george clooney finds himself in the midst of in out of sight . of the many pictures made from his books , the most recent three are get shorty , touch , and jackie brown , this one is arguably the best . the first big budget picture by director steven soderbergh of sex , lies , and videotape fame demonstrates his dedication to character development over plot . as richly textured as a brueghel painting , the story meanders along giving the players adequate , sometimes more than adequate , time and space to develop their characters . scott frank's screenplay skips backwards and forwards in time with great glee , which makes paying attention important . the effect of this fairly random method of storytelling is to add layers and dimensions that a straightforward rendition would miss . their flirting at the cocktail lounge beforehand and their partial disrobing in the hotel bedroom is more erotic than many more explicit scenes found in other films . soderbergh realizes that it is the anticipation of the affair that is frequently as satisfying , if not more so , than the tryst itself . along the way we meet a string of curious characters . and this is only part of the talented cast . audience's enjoyment of the picture will depend in part on their ability to derive satisfaction from such a cornucopia of corny characters . thanks especially to the hot chemistry between the two leads , the picture will delight most viewers even while the lack of much narrative drive may frustrate them . it is rated r for violence , profanity , and sexual situations and would be fine for most teenagers .",0.7
"when it comes to spoofs of horror films , one of the greatest of all time is surely mel brooks' young frankenstein , a movie that's as clever as it is funny . alas , dracula : dead and loving it doesn't come close to the level attained by young frankenstein . it's a toothless parody that misses more often than it hits . maybe one of the problems is that there have been so many attempts to lampoon vampires . a few , like george hamilton's love at first bite , have been genuinely funny . with dracula : dead and loving it , brooks is far from virgin territory . some of his jokes here have been used before , and , even for the good ones , familiarity mutes laughter . ultimately , however , dracula is infected with the same disease that has plagued the last several brooks films -- it's just not all that funny . sure , there are humorous bits here and there throughout the running length , but not enough to justify an entire movie . the storyline of dracula : dead and loving it is an amalgamation of all the various screen incarnations of stoker's tale . given the comic turn his career has taken since the early '80s , it's hard to believe that leslie nielsen was once a serious actor . his sense of timing is impeccable , and this asset has made him a sought-after commodity for a wide variety of spoofs . here , nielsen takes on the title role , but his presence can't resurrect this stillborn lampoon . there's no compelling reason to sit through dracula : dead and loving it . the sporadic humor promises some laughs , but the ninety minutes will go by slowly . the general failure of this movie leads to one obvious question : why couldn't brooks just leave dracula dead and buried ?",0.5
"stanley tucci should stick to acting . although admittedly not as bad or as ambitious as his last movie , the audacious failure called the impostors , this latest movie of tucci's hasn't much to recommend it other than its period sets . there is a sterling supporting cast ( patricia clarkson , hope davis , steve martin and susan sarandon ) , but they are so underutilized that they hardly count . imagine arranging for steve martin to be in your movie and then giving him a throwaway part . what a waste . ian holm , who looks like robinson crusoe in a goodwill suit , overacts with a vengeance . i'm joe gould !

"wow . riff-raff is a strikingly powerful film that combines a biting sense of humor with an uncompromising , true-to-life look at the lot of england's working class . while movies like this are often maudlin and sometimes depressingly difficult to watch , in this case , director ken loach ( whose previous efforts include kes and hidden agenda ) has guided his production down a narrow trail that perfectly balances comedy and drama . it's a daring move and the film succeeds because loach pulls it off . often , watching riff-raff is like seeing a home video . the realism is astonishing , and the background on the production makes it apparent how much trouble was taken to make it so . says loach , "" the realism stems from bill's writing and the people in the film . in addition , it's apparent that everyone involved knew how to act , as well . riff-raff contains one of the most unusual romances in recent memory . like everything else in the movie , their interaction is handled with an eye and ear towards mimicking real life . every line of dialogue between stevie and susan rings true . speaking of dialogue , riff-raff is in english , but fine line features has chosen to subtitle the movie ( in english ) for american consumption . why ? the heavy accents of the working class are more than occasionally difficult to understand . personally , i found the subtitles mostly unnecessary , but they will be invaluable to those unfamiliar with the guttural english used in this picture . best of all , riff-raff is not a downer . in addition to an overall lighthearted tone , there is enough comedy to keep this movie upbeat . there is a social message , but it doesn't bog down the film , perhaps because everything is told from the perspective of members of the lower class who view their lot pragmatically . no attempt is made to contrast the circumstances of the workers with those of the more-wealthy ( a theme that has been done many times before ) , so missing is the seething sense of indignation and moral outrage that often accompanies films such as riff-raff . in riff-raff , ken loach has fashioned a world that takes a few moments for the viewer to become immersed in . but once that displacement has occurred , the movie takes on a vivid life that will not be easily dispersed by the rolling of the end credits and the intrusion of reality . this is not a film of sudden shocks and emotional turbulence , but it is forceful and exceptionally worthwhile nonetheless .",0.8
"a so-so noir melodrama , that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the husband she's madly in love with . what keeps this melodrama going is the understated star performances generated by raymond burr and sterling hayden , bouncing off the fiercely passionate portrayal stanwyck gives . kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation , in many ways similar but a lot more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her lovelorn column . the best that can be said about this story , is that it's not bad and it had some sparks in it to keep you awake .",0.4
"while there's no sign "" raw meat "" tattooed on her forehead , anyone familiar with the genre knows her chances of getting out alive . actually , there aren't too many deaths in this movie , but in some ways that's unfortunate , because when man's best friend isn't adding to its body count , it's spending time showing the characters running around getting nothing done , engaging in poorly-written dialogue , or participating in some inane expository scene . admittedly , there are a few nice touches ( such as max's "" courting "" of a female dog to the tune of "" puppy love "" ) which show that writer/director john lafia was willing to make occasional stabs at parody . one could make a case , i suppose , that the entire movie is a wonderfully-conceived satire , but i don't think that was intention , nor does the overall script seem to bear out such an interpretation . if there was any question of the direction in which ally sheedy's career is going , it's answered here , where she turns in a non-performance in which she somehow manages to get out-acted by a dog . the most interesting thing about dr . jarret is his short bleached-blond hair . as horror/thriller movies go , man's best friend has a double disadvantage : it's slow-moving and the monster dog isn't immune to bullets . in fact , the ending is so abrupt and anticlimactic that it will leave many veterans of the genre feeling cheated . this film has the capacity for disappointing just about everybody , especially someone who walks in expecting to see beethoven's second .",0.31

"with lots of bullets that go zing , landmines that go boom , and vehicles that explode into fireballs , three kings would seem to have all of the ingredients , including a big name star ( george clooney ) , for a traditional summer movie . that the studio has released the picture instead in the fall , along with other oscar hopefuls , shows that they want us to view the picture as something significant . regardless of its hype and its respected writer/director , david o . russell ( spanking the monkey and flirting with disaster ) , three kings is really just a big-budget hollywood action picture , filled with lots of violence and explosions , masquerading as an art film . the film's showy look , like that of a cheap motel television in which the color and the brightness are turned to maximum , serves notice that three kings expects to be taken as something more than just another shoot 'em up . with his home movie-making proclivity for fast pans and zooms , the director manages to keep the audience's attention , which is important since the story frequently drifts aimlessly , getting lost in the desert as often as the movie's protagonists . adrianna , the story's only wholly comedic character , is not one to be messed with .

"it is a movie on an epic scale about a physician during the restoration . in the opening credits we learn that it is the time in england of the restoration of charles ii's monarchy as well of scientific endeavors and of pleasure . the puritans would have never permitted it . the movie has three distinct but related parts : the court , the quakers , and the plague . each has enough material to be a movie in its own right , but screenwriter rupert walters ( using a novel by rose tremain ) and editor garth craven have conspired to chop this all down to a movie of less than two hours in length . it felt as if it was a three and a half hour movie that the studio had ordered cut to a standard length for marketability . for whatever reason they did it , it makes for a choppy movie that is a delight to the senses , but leaves you wanting more that the movie delivers . as the movie opens we see the hustle and bustle of seventeenth century london . as the camera lens draws closer we see its squalor . it is a sweatshop where they do not even have adequate time to eat , but at least they get to do medical research of a sort . we are to assume that merivel is a great womanizer although to this point the movie has only touched on it , again reinforcing my theory that much film was left on the cutting room floor . the real motivation for seeing restoration is the production itself with sets by eugenio zanetti , costumes by james acheson , and cinematography by oliver stapleton . from the first open shot of london with its golden earth tones and elaborate set reminiscent of a brueghel painting , we sense that this picture will be special . my favorite cinematographic technique in the movie is the way light rushes in windows to bath the occupants of the room as if the light were the hand of god . indeed it was the only thing expressly forbidden of you .

"starring : anthony hopkins , emma thompson , james fox , christopher reeve director : james ivory producers : mike nichols , john calley , and ismail merchant screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala based on the novel by kazuo ishiguro music : richard robbins released by columbia pictures the cream always rises to the top , and such is the indisputable case with anthony hopkins' deeply moving portrayal of the stilted butler of darlington hall in the newest offering from merchant ivory . reuniting howards end co-stars hopkins and emma thompson , this offering is at once both better and not as impressive as last year's best picture contender . few will deny , however , that this is a movie well worth a trip to a theater . the warning is prophetic , but its consequences are not explored as fully as they might have been . nevertheless , we care far more about the interaction between miss kenton and mr . stevens than we do lord darlington's attempts to curtail war . we follow these two across more than twenty years , always hoping that something will crack stevens' perfect veneer of emotional dearth . in the end , it is movie's unwillingness to provide some sort of resolution that keeps the emotional power marginally below than that of a film like the age of innocence . tragedy without catharsis can be a bitter pill for any movie-goer to swallow . the method of storytelling is also somewhat suspect . while this movie is too good for us to complain about being cheated , it's hard not to acknowledge a sense of incompleteness . having viewed this interpretation , it is unthinkable that anyone could have replaced him . this monumental acting job--surely one of the best of the year , if not the best--is all the more impressive because of the lack of external emotional range in the butler . mr . hopkins is forced to employ a great deal of subtlety to bring out the turmoil beneath the surface . revel in the presentation of stevens , and the complexity of his personality . it's a rare film that successfully creates a character this compelling , fascinating , and real . despite being such a cold fish , the butler captures our sympathies and holds them , and we find ourselves desperately wishing for the impossible . tears will doubtless be shed by some members of the audience , and this film is far more deserving of them than any of numerous manipulative melodramas . genuine emotional impact--that's the key to the success of the remains of the day . emma thompson does her usual good job with her part , but the role of ms . kenton lacks the substance of her character in howards end ( and even much ado about nothing , if you're looking for a comparison from this year ) . that's not to say that ms . thompson has been saddled with a featherweight ; nothing could be further from the truth . but this is stevens' story , and ultimately sally kenton enjoys no more than a supporting role . most disappointing of all the characters is that of james fox's darlington . we're constantly told how "" good "" and "" noble "" darlington is , but rarely shown more than glimpses of the inner man . it is , for example , more difficult to understand stevens' unquestioning devotion to his employer . no one would confuse congressman lewis with a real character , but it doesn't seem that james ivory was interested in presenting more than a stereotype . lewis is involved for two reasons , and once both aims are accomplished , there's no real reason for him to be in the story at all . he serves his purpose , and that's good enough . the symbolism is the last scene is best described as cryptic . while almost any interpretation could be considered valid , the overall impression is that the final moments of the remains of the day are largely superfluous . lest the tone of portions of this review seem too negative , let me reiterate that this is an engaging and powerful motion picture , every bit the rival of howards end , and perhaps in many ways more emotionally wrenching ( this film is probably better paced , as well ) . merchant ivory with flaws is superior to near-perfection from most other producer/director teams , and the remains of the day is certainly among the better productions of the year . tragic love stories often hit home with the hardest impact , and few are better-crafted and more intelligently presented than that of mr . stevens and miss kenton .",0.87
"his unique and magical art form is something well worth preserving . set in china in the 1930s , the film has a strong sense of place . the narrow alleyways give way to colorful houses encrusted in meandering bundles of mystical fog . the basic food staples at the market seems so real that you'll begin to smell them . one of the most satisfying , yet most unusual , aspects of the production is the music . in this very chinese film , jiping zhao's richly melancholic music sounds reminiscent of some of the great american movie music of the 1950s , especially on the waterfront . sometimes , it was orphans trying to offer themselves up in return for a reliable source of food . and sometimes , it was just a crook making a nefarious living . in a performance that avoids any hint of cloyingness , zhou ren-ying plays the smart and resourceful doggie . the two leads deliver exquisite performances and demonstrate genuine chemistry between each other . it is easy to care as much for them as they do for one another . there's only one thing amiss with doggie . you guessed it . although you think you'll figure out how grandpa comes upon this fact , you haven't got a chance in a million . minglun wei's charming screenplay pulls the solution out of left field , but it manages to make sense in context . da-yuan mu's intimate cinematography works best in its small moments of revealing honesty . it is most spectacular , however , in the more dramatic ones as in the movie's beginning sequence , in which a dragon is illuminated with sparks like a million fireflies and shaded in the ensuing clouds of smoke . the director has a gift for making small things special . grandpa has a pet monkey that's no baboon . the animal is the most consistently serious character in the movie , and he takes good care of his master . no dog has ever been more loyal . if they ever want to remake lassie with a monkey , this is the one to get . this simple tale , well told , has its share of tragedies . your heart will be in every one of them , but you'll never feel manipulated or cheated . a small movie worth seeking out and savoring . the film is in mandarin with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably be pg for thematic elements , brief nudity and a couple of mild profanities . the picture would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested .",0.7

"director : alan rudolph . the collection of authors , journalists and performers who gathered for lunches at new york's hotel algonquin in the 1920s are among those peculiarly american individuals who are perhaps more famous for being famous than for anything they actually said or did . there is a great historical disagreement as to who was there at any given time , to whom certain famous quotes should be attributed , and even whether those quotes were actually spoken . more than anything , they became symbolic of the kind of dissolute jazz age bon vivants immortalized by fitzgerald and hemingway . parker and the vicious circle , an uneven but still quite intriguing examination of the algonquin round table's most famous member . parker as it has ever been in rudolph's work . altman's trademark overlapping dialogue is particularly noteworthy , and it is one of rudolph's most questionable decisions . the round table was defined by the volleys of bon mots exchanged by its members , and while many clever lines come through , nearly as many are drowned out by other conversation . i often caught uproarious laughter in response to a joke i hadn't heard . rudolph uses the interactions of these individuals to demonstrate a superficiality which defined dorothy parker's world : everyone at the table was too busy trying to be clever to pay much attention to anything anyone else had to say . "" i write doo-dads , "" parker comments in one scene , "" because it's a doo-dad kind of town , "" and that remark speaks volumes about the round table regulars , and perhaps even the jazz age as a whole . as we watch parker slip deeper and deeper into depression , it becomes astonishing that none of her so-called friends , with the exception of benchley , ever seem to notice or care . leigh's performance is stunning , though she does affect a speech pattern that sounds like a gin-soaked variation on her stanwyck/hepburn bit from the hudsucker proxy , and she seemed to swallow many of her lines . it's a piece of work made all the more challenging by the odd structure of the script , which has leigh playing parker at several different phases of her life , as well as reading selections from parker's poetry directly to the camera . she manages to capture the soul of an extremely troubled survivor whose final line in the film ( "" i can't believe i made it "" ) is both comic and touching . her performance * is * mrs . parker , and through all of rudolph's fits and starts i found that i actually felt i had met dorothy parker .",0.7

"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .",0.7

"yes , it is time again to go back to one of science fiction's longest running soap operas , star trek . its fans will likely love this latest episode . lesser devotees , like this reviewer , will probably be entertained but slightly confused . although most of the movie is relatively straightforward , some sections play like a foreign language film without benefit of subtitles . the story this time concerns the ba'ku , a people who have "" warp capability "" but who have rejected technology . the intelligent but talky script mixes in some nice doses of humor . he then proceeds to demonstrate this ability , providing a nice little sight gag . too often director jonathan frakes , who plays the part of cmdr . william t . riker , has a sense of pacing that borders on the glacial . this is one of many soporific scenes that would have been better eliminated or at least trimmed significantly . although the story has a nice twist toward the end that almost everyone will appreciate , the movie seems designed to please star trek fans while not caring much about the casual viewers . taken as a whole the movie is fun even if it does contain several long , dull passages . star trek : insurrection runs 1 : 43 . it is rated pg for sci-fi violence and sexuality and would be fine for kids around 9 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , said that he could not compare this one to other star trek movies since this was his first one , but he really liked it and gave it * * * . his favorite parts were the action sequences , especially those using the phasers and the other guns . he said that the movie was frequently confusing about exactly who were the good guys and who were the bad and what each was up to .",0.6

"quentin tarantino may prove to have a more profound effect on the immediate future of cinema than any other single individual . it's not just that other new filmmakers will be mimicking his style , though such recent fare as love and a . 45 shows that he is already having an influence in that respect . no , tarantino's most important legacy may be that films which until only recently would have seemed doomed to obscurity are finding enthusiastic distribution because the audience has spoken : dark , funny and twisted is * in * . the first beneficiary of the tarantino effect might be the british import shallow grave , a macabre little thriller with some shaky characterizations but a great look and feel . thrillers like shallow grave depend on tight plotting , tense situations and atmosphere , and it hits about two out of three . the point behind disposing of the body is somewhat lost on me , since they could have reported the death without reporting the money , and a few late developments are glossed over so quickly that it's easy for the audience to wonder exactly what happened when . but it is mostly in retrospect that these problems appear , because shallow grave is a pretty intense piece of work . a pair of interviews with a police detective are extremely effective , as you begin to watch the roommates' resolve crumble , and danny boyle's direction highlights a marvelous set , the massive flat shared by juliet , david and alex . the lighting , the bold colors and the seemingly endless hiding places create a mounting paranoia that sweeps you in even as it sweeps in the characters . yet for all its tension and eventual excursions into viscera , shallow grave is essentially a character piece that examines how the fragile relationships between these three individuals are shattered by their shared secret . unfortunately , the other two leads are not nearly as well developed . kerry fox is savvy and manipulative as juliet , but there is something missing , a bit too much left unsaid , particularly her refusal to deal with the men who call for her or approach her at social functions . while the story could have been about how their mutual participation in this event changes all three , it ends up that david is the only one whose state of mind is examined in any depth . still , shallow grave works fundamentally because it keeps the pressure on . it is always only a matter of time before a "" perfect crime "" is revealed in its imperfection , and the multiple double- crosses are fun to watch . though shallow grave could have been tighter and more psychological , eccleston's intense performance and a few nasty little twists make it a thriller that keeps you watching , guessing and squirming .",0.7

"it has been a long time since a film inspired as profound a case of "" what am i missing ?

"screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import "" black adder , "" a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes "" lightning strike , "" and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing .",0.7

"screenplay : marc lawrence , based on the original screenplay by neil simon . producers : robert evans , robert w . cort , david madden and teri schwartz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 88 minutes . the out-of-towners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of pooh-poohing . it's a remake ( of a neil simon-penned 1970 original which i have never seen ) , it's a vehicle to re-unite two stars of a previous film ( steve martin and goldie hawn , from 1992's housesitter ) , and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality . the out-of-towners often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract its guffaws , yet it still manages to extract its fair share . the comic energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable john cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying . it shouldn't be a surprise that the out-of-towners feels derivative , and not just because it's a remake . nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar , from the pairing of the two stars , to martin's fuming in a planes , trains & automobiles scenario , to hawn's earnest ditziness , to cleese's resurrection of basil fawlty and python-esque cross-dressing . while the script by marc lawrence ( writer of forces of nature , who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac ) pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage , it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick situations and tirades . at times , those situations and tirades feel forced ; you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat . at plenty of others , the actors give the old-fashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen . even more wonderful is cleese , a comic treasure too rarely seen . he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep , but he still sends a charge through the out-of-towners every moment he's on screen . cleese's scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film . i do wish the out-of-towners had shown more restraint with its characters , subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation . it's not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination , but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didn't need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles . you may find a lot of the out-of-towners familiar and foolish ; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself . there's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"going into the movie , i have to admit that i wasn't optimistic . oliver stone proved with the doors that just because someone in the music business is surrounded by controversy , that doesn't mean that his or her life will translate into an enjoyable motion picture . however , where i found the story of jim morrison's life to be dull and pretentious , i discovered energy and passion in what's love got to do with it . the music scenes are electric . superbly acted and choreographed , they are some of the best of their kind to be found in any recent movie . the choice of music for the soundtrack is also noteworthy ; many of the songs will be familiar to even those who have had limited exposure to ike and tina turner . punctuating the film's energized performances are several darkly violent scenes . these are frighteningly intense and starkly graphic , not because they are especially bloody ( although blood is in evidence ) , but because the participants do such an excellent job at bringing to the surface highly- believable emotions during the circumstances . often , abuse scenes are over-dramatized , but what's love got to do with it avoids that trap . the goal of realism is attained . any jekyll and hyde personae demands ability and range , both elements of which fishburne exhibits . his ike turner has many facets , transcending the level of the common "" bad husband "" ( much as his character in deep cover gave that movie more substance than the script strove for ) . what's love got to do with it is an exceptionally-paced movie . credit director brian gibson for this . he avoids the tendency of biographies to get mired in irrelevancies . the film , nearly two hours long , seems much shorter than its running length . gibson also manages to neatly transition his project through the turbulent decades of the sixties and seventies , effectively capturing the essence of those eras . it's not just the costumes and hairdos that reflect the times , but the attitudes of the participants as well . you don't have to be a tina turner fan to appreciate this movie , but no matter how you feel about her music , what's love got to do with it cannot fail to impart an impression of her courage and inner strength . although ultimately a triumphant story , this biography doesn't see its subject through rose-colored glasses . it takes chances , and that's why the movie works . visually impressive and aurally dazzling , what's love got to do with it is a great alternative to some of the bloated , overbudgeted summer films .",0.7

"first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being . it is a playful and provocative look at determining one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within , featuring an actual celebrity , the performer , john malkovich , who is playing himself , as the mind who is being entered . if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that , it might cost as much as $200 for a 15 minute sightseeing trip down that path , the charge established in the film for such a trip , while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience . the running gag being , that the overhead and the rent are also low here . since the glimpse into malkovich's head is more or less fictional , it's delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment . the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy . but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving . what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize . and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor , it is that he comes across as a good person , someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense . this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an art-house indie , yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production .",0.8

"stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece "" the grand illusion , "" does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , "" show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man .

"screenplay : robert towne , from a story by ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : john woo . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . if i didn't know any better , i'd swear tom cruise was trying to steal a franchise out from under pierce brosnan . take a look at mission : impossible 2 for a moment , and see if the elements don't sound familiar : a government agent on a dangerous mission . a villain with a dastardly plot . a beautiful romantic interest . stunts , action sequences and high-tech gadgetry a-plenty . add a phenomenally talented action director like john woo to the mix , and maybe its time to ask q for a little cruise control on the old aston-martin . right ? not at all , as it turns out . john woo's last film was 1997's face/off , the latest in a long line of films ( a better tomorrow , the killer ) that showed the director's gift for mixing outrageous action sequences with strong character content . don't expect any such complexities from mission : impossible 2 . robert towne's script tries to provide an anchor in hunt's relationship with nyah , but it materializes so instantaneously that it's impossible to give it any weight or consequence . dougray scott , meanwhile , is an effectively nasty villain , but i'll be damned if i could figure out the history between him and hunt that's supposed to give their tete-a-tete more sock . anthony hopkins turns up for a couple of uncredited scenes as hunt's vaguely menacing new superior , then disappears without any further acknowledgement of his vague menace . every time woo slows things down for a moment of dramatic significance , it's just a longer time to dwell on the fact that there really isn't any dramatic signficance . mission : impossible 2 still could have been a great ride with plenty of that trademark woo action , and it gets off to a rousing start with a sequence showcasing hunt doing a little recreational rock-climing . once it does get going again , it doesn't really stop until the closing credits -- there are whiz-bang car chases , two-guns-a-blazing john woo shooting matches , slow-mo slugfests and bombs going off like the whole movie was timed to the end of the "" 1812 overture . "" it's great stuff , even if some of the devices are a bit too familiar from woo's other films , but by the time it finally rolls around it's almost too late . an action film with this much exposition better make the exposition worth our while , or the audience will just end up wondering why it was wasting valuable action time . the original 1996 mission : impossible was nobody's idea of classic cinema , but it did have that undeniably nerve-wracking computer room break-in sequence to go with its high-energy finale . mission : impossible 2 nods to that highlight in yet another break-in sequence , along with a nice gag about hunt's preferred operational style . i had hoped for more than homage to a mediocre blockbuster from john woo -- something with its own show-stopping set pieces and a compelling story to boot . but ultimately , there's no financial point to cooking up brilliant storytelling for a franchise , because people will come no matter what the film is "" about . "" that's why brosnan , mgm and the estate of ian fleming can rest easy that there will always be a market for their films , the tom cruises of the world be hanged . there's enough furiously paced woo action in the final forty minutes to keep mission : impossible 2 from crashing and burning ; there's just not enough to make it anything special , nor enough depth to the story to fill in the blanks between chases . anyone who's followed woo's career knows he's better than this material , but maybe there's only so much even a gifted film-maker can do with a product that's first and foremost about a brand name . the name on the director's chair can only get in the way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"i don't think any american filmmaker in my lifetime has had his personal life as closely associated with his films as woody allen . the compulsively auto-analytical allen created a classic film persona , but he also created a monster : a body of work constantly being read for clues about its creator . at first , it may sound like another apologia for the artist as world-class clod , a la deconstructing harry , but there's actually something more going on in the character of emmet ray . if he's not the best there is at his art , he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from emotional connection . i'm coming to believe that sean penn may be the most talented american actor alive . penn does so many things right as emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that allen doesn't quite know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant . the light-hearted structure , with jazz scholars commenting talking-head style on emmet's misadventures , becomes jarring and distracting as emmet's story unfolds . episodes like emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent contest or his role in a botched hold-up ( told in three possible variations ) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a woody allen sensibility . only when allen holds penn unexpectedly in the dead center of a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what he has working for him . samantha morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a mute laundress with whom emmet has a lengthy relationship , and it's certainly an impressive physical performance . it's also clear how much morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story , only to be replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered uma thurman . but this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead performance of a fascinating character , in spite of a structure always on the verge of sabotaging that character . you might suspect that the notoriously private allen was using sweet and lowdown as a first attempt to really open himself up emotionally on screen , but found it so awkward that he had to keep telling jokes . or maybe he's just an imperfect filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film . naaaaahhhh . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6

"fear of a black hat is the 1990s version of this is spinal tap , skewering rap music on the same stake that rob reiner used to impale heavy metal . for three-quarter of its running length , this is a first- rate parody of the most bawdy kind . it is unapologetically politically incorrect , and some of the biggest laughs come at the most off-color jokes . there's virtually no stone in the world of rap music left unturned by black hat , which has something to say about everything from drug dealing and gun violence to the new wave of black film directors . as was the case with spinal tap , the premise behind fear of a black hat is that someone is doing a documentary . the film opens with a warning to the audience that fear of a black hat will make use of a number of potentially offensive terms , but does not intend to do so gratuitously . it then repeats each of those words several times , and prints them on the screen for good measure . from this moment on , we know that we're in the hands of an accomplished satirist , and the result is predictably better than other feeble efforts such as cb4 and those elements of the wayne's world movies which tried something similar . from that point on , the jokes come faster than the uses of the word . the parodies of rap videos are inspired--writer/director rusty cundieff injects an mtv-like glamor , but makes sure that each possesses all sorts of excesses . with titles like "" guerrillas in the midst "" and "" my peanuts "" with lyrics that will not be reprinted here , cundieff has found rich ground to hoe . almost every facet of the rap culture gets similar treatment . a marquee in chicago refuses to use the word "" niggaz , "" so it calls nwh "" negroes with hats .

"" much like this year's the spitfire grill , it succeeds only on a superficial level , failing to harness the deeper emotional currents of jon avnet's 1992 picture . and , although the spitfire grill is clearly flawed , it promotes better character identification than the grass harp . here , when the inevitable death occurs , it's not as painful as it could , or should , be . the grass harp is far more effective at delivering light humor than drama . the brief exchange between old screen buddies walter matthau and jack lemmon is delightful , as are almost all of the scenes featuring mary steenburgen . aside from steenburgen's promiscuous revivalist and matthau's judge , however , none of the characters are especially interesting . dolly , whose transformation from meekness to self- sufficiency represents the story's fulcrum , is played with such reserve by piper laurie that she often fades into the background . sissy spacek isn't given much to do other than look pinched and act crotchety , and edward furlong is his usual one-note picture of surliness . only walter matthau , acting under his son's direction , exudes life and energy . i would have enjoyed seeing more of the judge ; everyone else is forgettable . the story related by the grass harp is nice enough , but it doesn't amount to much . for this kind of drama to succeed , we need to develop more powerful feelings than those engendered by dolly , verena , and collin . the title is said to refer to the sound made by the wind rustling through fields of uncut grass -- "" a harp of voices telling stories .

"upon seeing the print ads and commercials for this movie , it might occur to you that this story has been done before--and you would be absolutely correct . those who have seen richard lester's '70s tongue-in-cheek version of the adventure should avoid this one , lest you feel compelled to hurl popcorn and invectives at the screen . the first indication of trouble with this movie is in the casting . it's not a stroke of brilliance to choose sheen , sutherland , and curry as the triumphant trio ( although , to his credit , sutherland does a credible job as a moody athos ) . it's an even worse choice to pick chris o'donnell as d'artagnan , since he seems more concerned about not messing up his perm than in giving a decent accounting of himself . tim curry is entirely too feeble to make a credible villain , and hugh o'connor's version of king louis looks like something out of bill and ted's excellent adventure . two performers are effective , but they're mostly smothered by all the ineptitude around them . michael wincott does a marvellous job as the villainous ex-musketeer rocheford ( and yes , there is a cheesy joke about the name ) . her role is small , but she's pretty good . which is more than can be said about numerous contrived circumstances and lines of dialogue . is loughery serious when he expects us to believe that a musketeer would actually ask , "" you got a name , boy ? "" something's rotten in the country of france , and if this script is anything to judge by , perhaps william shatner is shouldering entirely too much of the blame for the failure of the fifth star trek feature . the three musketeers is supposed to be high adventure and , while there are a few nice swordfights , most of the action isn't likely to provoke more than a "" ho-hum "" reaction . director stephen herek should go back to bill and ted's excellent adventure . he obviously doesn't have what it takes here . in much the same way that kevin costner's lifeless robin hood : prince of thieves butchered the legends of sherwood forest , so this film singlehandedly bludgeons the three musketeers . in this case , it's even worse , though . here , tim curry manages the dubious distinction of seeming restrained when going over-the-top . there have been other , better versions of this story . if there is a reason to see this movie , it's for the five-minute extended preview of disney's upcoming the lion king ( what we see is actually the opening musical number ) , but such quick satisfaction is hardly value for the dollar .

"it's not the mixture of comedy and drama--plenty of films manage to intertwine the two with aplomb ; rather , it's the vastly different performance levels of the leads . debra winger , a mature and competent actress , has developed a dramatic style that she uses to good effect . billy crystal , on the other hand , is his usual character : self-deprecating , glib , and entirely unconvincing in scenes requiring emotional displays . put simply , when winger shines , crystal is awful , and when crystal is at his best , winger fades into the background . the most apparent result is that the characters never really connect . saturday night and forget paris offer compelling evidence that crystal in his capacity as director/actor should stay away from films that require dramatic range . the man is more of a personality than a performer . he writes good jokes and has a funny delivery . in this film , his best moments occur when he's trying to make the audience laugh . the script , however , goes for slick one-liners in place of woody allen's insight , and the ending lacks emotional honesty . but what else have we come to expect from lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , kings of the happy ending ? these two dribble so much honey on every screenplay they touch that it's a wonder audiences haven't gone into sugar shock . but even this unexpected turn of events can't break the lovers apart . this is one of those rare occasions when voiceovers actually work--they allow for moments of comic flair to punctuate a story that often gets too sentimental . unfortunately , this also means that a fine supporting cast gets very little screen time . if so , he's missed the mark . with its uneven tone , forget paris doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse its faults . crystal and winger don't make a vibrant couple , and the various tribulations in their characters' relationship seem like episodes designed to set up the "" wonderful "" ending . in his second directorial stint , crystal has repeated most of the faults of his first ( the aforementioned mr . at least this time , we don't have to endure the terrible old-age makeup on top of everything else .",0.56
"imagine edward scissorhands under the control of a mainstream director rather than someone offbeat and eccentric like tim burton . the result would have been just another motion picture about a prototypical misfit trying to find his niche--a movie with a lot of manipulation and too many easy answers . powder is such a film . unmistakably designed with teenagers in mind , this movie presses numerous emotional hotbuttons in a manner that is as obvious as it is skillful . on some levels , the film works . it tells a modern-day fable with enough pseudo-scientific gobbledygook to make the scenario sound almost plausible . powder is well-paced and effective at getting the audience to care about the principal personality . it's likely that anyone who has ever felt like an outsider will see an element of himself or herself in the title character , as essayed by sean patrick flanery . it's easy to sympathize and identify with the loner . however , while doing all that competently , powder consistently avoids taking chances . the script , which backs away from real dramatic conflict , lacks courage , preferring hollywood-type scenarios to something grittier . the title character always does the right thing . we know from the beginning how these characters are going to react in any situation , and never feel anything for them because no attempt is made to give them humanity . in this entire film , powder is the only multi-dimensional personality . everyone else , good or bad , is merely filling a stock role . powder is an albino , with the characteristic white skin and pink eyes , but that's not all that's unusual about him-- his body has no hair and he possesses "" the most advanced intellect in the history of humankind .

"apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders . the prison atmosphere of hostility , constant danger , noise , and inhumanity , was fully captured , as the film had the gritty , realistic look of a prison . the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges . the acting was just fine . i don't know if anyone seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of rehabilitation . the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances . but it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into what its message was . the film didn't feel like it was freely flowing along , and because of that the story floundered at times .",0.5
"the feature debut of director kevin allen is exceptionally profane , frequently violent , and occasionally grotesque , which all adds up to a reasonably high "" hipness "" quotient in a genre where quentin tarantino is king . ultimately , however , like so many wannabes , twin town lacks several key ingredients that its predecessor possessed -- notably style , originality , and depth . cue the opening credits . unfortunately , the movie's satirical sophistication never again approaches this level . the world we're plunged into is gray and flat , and allen's presentation of it is too-often uninspired . outlandishness for its own sake isn't interesting , just as a film's status as a "" black comedy "" doesn't excuse its multitude of flaws . trainspotting was an explosion of creative edginess ; twin town rarely provokes anything more enthusiastic than a yawn . allen's movie , which takes place in swansea , wales ( called , appropriately enough , "" the graveyard of ambition "" by dylan thomas ) , introduces us to a cast of characters who could have been lifted out of a bad monty python sketch ( one of those where you wonder how such a talented troupe could come up with something so unfunny ) . in spite of their car-stealing hobby , glue-sniffing habits , and violent tendencies , the de facto protagonists , julian and jeremy , are easily the two most dreary people that we meet ( the director has aptly described them as intentionally two-dimensional ) . twin town commits a black comedy cardinal sin by believing that it's a lot more incisive and funny than it actually is . in fact , the term "" boring "" wouldn't be out of place as a descriptor of the endless first half . that's because , at least early on , twin town is just about a bunch of off-putting , undeveloped characters doing a variety of dodgy things . we've seen it all before ; it's time to offer a new twist . the dialogue is passably interesting for only one reason : it's easily the most profane i have ever encountered on screen ( there are something like 500 uses of the "" f "" word , or one of its permutations ) . the plot -- or what passes for one -- is pointless and occasionally muddled ( especially near the beginning ) . the good news is that twin town gets markedly better during its second half . twin town invites comparisons to other movies because it's not absorbing enough on its own to grab an audience's attention . none of the characters are of great interest and the acting is of variable quality . the film apparently played well overseas , which is good for its financial stability , because it's unlikely to make much of a dent in the summer box office on this side of the atlantic . for a movie that deals with doubles , twin town barely has half of what it needs to make for compelling viewing .",0.4

"a more conventional and not as absorbing remake of mystery of the wax museum , 1933 , made with the gimmick of 3-d ( used in a fun way with novelty shots of a barker batting paddleballs in your face and a murderer jumping seemingly out at the audience ) . it also effectively used the special warner color process . strangely enough , the film's director , andr ? de toth , lost the sight of one eye and therefore couldn't appreciate the effects of 3-d since he had no depth perception . this is also the film where vincent price made his mark as a villain figure in horror films and was typecast forever in that role . he wanted to make the museum more commercial by displaying a chamber of horrors , but jarrod is only interested in creating real-life beauty from historical figures such as marie antoinette and joan of arc . it was a decent enough horror film , as seen in this cable tv version of regular 2-d , but it lacked more sparks to it . it seemed to languor at points of its story , and its grand guignol characterization was too often wasted by touristy tours of the museum . they were interesting , but didn't add much to the story . all the creepiness comes from price and igor .",0.6

"with for your eyes only , roger moore's fifth appearance as bond and the twelfth entry in the long-running series , 007 enters the 1980s with a return to the "" glory days "" of the '60s . realizing it would be tough to top the technical glitz of moonraker , the film makers wisely chose not to try , opting instead for a retro-bond adventure that takes the intrepid superspy back into familiar territory : kgb involvement in a plan that centers on classified british secrets . but that's not the only aspect of for your eyes only that looks more to bond's past than his future . on a per- minute basis , there are more stunts and chases in this film than in any previous 007 adventure , and some are quite spectacular . there's a car chase , a shoot-and-dodge race down icy slopes and through a bobsled run , a tense mountain-scaling sequence , and nearly as much underwater action as in thunderball . for your eyes only has its share of breathtaking moments . as for the music -- suffice it to say that john barry is missed . alas , julian glover's kristatos won't be remembered as one of the great 007 bad guys . while the actor's ability is beyond question , it's usually not talent that makes for a memorable bond villain , and glover just isn't over-the-top or nasty enough .

"metro is about as generic as action pictures come . yet , despite the familiar nature of all this material , it somehow manages to rise above its cliche-riddled origins and ascend to a watchable -- and , at times , even enjoyable -- level . it revived his reputation as a top-money funny man , and proved that , under the right circumstances , he can still generate a healthy box office return . it remains to be seen whether metro will continue the revival or plunge the actor back into the murky pit from which he so recently emerged . while metro isn't nearly as bad as either beverly hills cop 3 or another 48 hours , one wonders if movie-goers , who stayed away from those features in droves , will avoid this one too . somehow , almost against the odds , murphy manages to make roper interesting . he's cut from the mold of dozens of motion picture cops , but , through sheer force of personality , murphy makes him unique and likable . it continues to baffle me what film makers see in him . michael wincott , who seemingly never plays a good guy , does a perfectly adequate job as the piece's villain . and , even though i thought metro's love story was lame , i enjoyed the work of british newcomer carmen ejogo , despite her lack of chemistry with murphy . carter evidences a great deal of aptitude in directing the action sequences . they are well-paced and tightly-edited ( although there are times when it's obvious that murphy is using the services of a stunt double ) , and keep the viewer from thinking too much about the flawed , episodic plotline . even the film's most obvious steal -- the chase through san francisco's streets immortalized in bullitt -- adds enough new twists , including a thrilling runaway cable car skid -- to make it entertaining in its own right . ultimately , however , owing to too many derivative elements and an erratic story that runs out of steam about halfway through , metro is only partially-satisfying . i suppose any viewer's reaction will depend on whether they choose to see this particular glass as half-full or half-empty . murphy fans and action junkies will probably find enough here to keep them involved and upbeat . everyone else will likely see this material as disappointingly over-familiar . in the wasteland of early-1997 releases , you could do worse than metro , but , by year's end , few people are likely to remember the title , let alone the premise .",0.6
"sleuth , a 1972 "" thinking person's thriller , "" is a rich , engaging motion picture with surprises lurking in the shadows behind every narrative corner . it's a perfect metaphor for all that is to come , as the two men square off in a series of increasingly- desperate games . this is the kind of movie where the payoff isn't about getting to the end , but in savoring every moment on the long , winding trip that takes us there . this is essentially a two-man stage show transformed into a movie . with the exception of a brief showing by british thespian alec cawthorne , the only actors on screen are olivier and caine . both are so good that there's not a moment when we wish for someone else to interrupt their duel . never has such seemingly limited one-on-one interaction been so arresting . olivier is universally recognized as one of the best actors ever to grace the screen ( big or small ) . whether as heathcliffe in wuthering heights , darcy in pride and prejudice , the lead in hamlet , moriarty in the seven per cent solution , or lord marchmain in "" brideshead revisited , "" olivier never disappointed . sleuth is easily one of his meatiest roles -- a chance to let go and act with relish . andrew wyke is a petty snob , but olivier makes him into a figure of both great humor and great tragedy . while we never sympathize with andrew , we do something far more important -- we understand him . olivier received one of his ten career acting oscar nominations for his work in this film , and , while it would be hyperbole to call this his most impressive outing , it's certainly one of his most memorable . michael caine's career has been somewhat more checkered than olivier's . nevertheless , while one might question the man's motives for appearing in certain films , there's no doubting his talent , and it's all on display in sleuth . but , as a result of andrew's cruelty , we soon recognize there's steel beneath milo's mild-mannered exterior . the brilliance of caine's portrayal is that we accept and believe every small transformation of personality that milo undergoes . at this point , i want to insert a warning into this review : because it's virtually impossible to discuss sleuth in any detail without giving away some of the surprises , i'm cautioning readers who want a "" virgin "" experience to stop reading now ( and come back once you've seen the movie ) . while my intention is not to reveal everything ( the ending , for example , will go unmentioned ) , certain plot elements will be exposed . and , while sleuth can easily be enjoyed by those who know the story inside out , why spoil some of the fun if you haven't already seen it ? to milo , it sounds like the perfect plan . there's only one problem ? andrew isn't serious . milo proves that not only is he a player of andrew's caliber , but he's faster , less principled , and more shrewd . by the time the end credits roll , it's clear who has had the final laugh . the viewer sits enraptured through the entire match between these two players , watching a series of unexpected plot twists unravel on-screen . the labyrinth at the beginning is indeed an apt metaphor . it's easy enough to guess that sleuth began life on the stage ? the narrative , with its limited setting ( most of the action takes place within a few rooms in andrew's house ) and focus on dialogue and character interaction is the kind of approach one would expect from a play . but it's hard to imagine that any live version could have been as riveting without olivier and caine , who elevate sleuth from the level of a rollicking good story to a masterpiece . here , the acting is the key , and it is never found lacking . of course , i don't mean to downplay the contribution of director joseph mankiewicz or playwright/screenwriter andrew shaffer , both of whom share credit with the actors for sleuth's success . shaffer's script is delicious ? witty , intelligent , and full of the unexpected . and , while olivier certainly has all the best lines , caine has the most glorious non-dialogue moments , such as the scene in which he dresses up as a clown in preparation for breaking into andrew's house . those who enjoyed the convolutions in david fincher's the game will find that sleuth offers many of the same pleasures without the most obvious drawback ( blatant manipulation of the audience ) . this tremendously entertaining motion picture is as effective today , more than a quarter of a century after its release , as it was in 1972 . it's not the easiest movie to find on videotape ( although it has just been released in the new dvd format ) , and many of the existing copies are in poor condition , but it's more than worth the effort to seek out .

"if it does nothing else , the ghost and the darkness will make you realize just how brilliant steven spielberg's execution of jaws is . using a similar ( albeit land-bound ) premise -- hunting down bloodthirsty predators -- this movie devolves into a silly series of animal attacks and chases . the camerawork is frenetic and confusing , and the big confrontations are as likely to provoke unintentional laughter as edge- of-the-seat excitement . in his 1975 thriller , spielberg proved that the man-against- beast struggle , if done properly , can make for a compelling motion picture . with the ghost and the darkness , director stephen hopkins tries unsuccessfully to generate the same level of tension . while hopkins' film making skills aren't of the same caliber as spielberg's ( one man made a nightmare on elm street 5 ; the other , schindler's list ) , the lion's share of the blame for this movie's failure can be laid squarely on the shoulders of veteran screenwriter william goldman , whose script is contrived and inadequate . in jaws , it was thrilling to watch the failed attempts to kill the enemy ; here , it's just frustrating . actually , taken as high camp , it's possible to enjoy the ghost and the darkness on a reasonably consistent basis . in addition to giving kilmer and douglas some wonderfully loony lines of dialogue , the script spends a lot of time on unnecessarily convoluted schemes to kill the beasts . somehow , i don't think hopkins intended this scene to be as funny as it is . there is a promising , although largely unexplored , story buried within the ghost and the darkness . building a railroad bridge across the tsavo river has the potential to generate some potent drama . of course , the ghost and the darkness is only interested in this material as background , so no attempt is made to examine the pressures and difficulties of railroad construction . and , man-eating animals aside , what about the inherent difficulties of raising such an imposing structure under stringent time and environmental constraints ? at first , i thought the film makers' reluctance to give us a good , clear view of them was to build suspense . unfortunately , it becomes clear that the real reason has more to do with poor special effects than a desire to tease the audience . the animatronic lions look terrible . one wonders why , with all the impressive twisters and spaceships that were zipping around on screens this summer , the ghost and the darkness can't come up with a pair of credible lions . val kilmer is either badly miscast , bored , or a combination of the two . his patterson is dull and largely unsympathetic . as a hero , he leaves a lot to be desired . unfortunately , douglas doesn't show up until the film is half over , so it's necessary to struggle through the first forty-five minutes without his energetic boost . for those who are interested in observing the habits of real lions and viewing genuine life-and-death struggles in africa , i direct your attention to the leopard son , which is still in theatrical release . that well-constructed documentary has stronger drama , tension , and cinematography than the supposedly-real story told in the ghost and the darkness . true , it's missing tom wilkinson sneering , michael douglas smirking , and val kilmer looking bored , but no movie can boast everything . -- ingmar bergman",0.55
"welcome to salem , and being the late 1600s , its time for witches . hocus pocus was disney's 1993 ode to halloween , and one of disney's lamest comedies . well , they do come back to life , but for all the laughs they get they should have stayed firmly in the grave . the script by neil cuthbert , mick garris , and david kirschner never finds its footing . sometimes it tries to be a beetlejuice clone , and other times it thinks it is a romantic comedy . it never has any convictions about its direction and stays constantly adrift . the best that can be said about the acting by the witches is that it is , well , bizarre . and rarely funny . for some reason , midler gets most of the dialog and the screen time . as for the other two , maybe their background roles are an advantage so that most people will not realize they were ever associated with this picture . making like the supremes , they jump right in and sing and dance their hearts out on stage . too bad , they couldn't have conjured up a little imagination and at least a few token laughs . the show should be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the show was "" good "" but complained that he thought "" the language was inappropriate .

"sometimes it takes a while for a movie to reveal its true colors . at this point you can already sense that the entire movie will be filled with such balderdash . don't be surprised if many members of your audience find themselves laughing uncontrollably at all the wrong moments in the movie's ridiculous plot . the film , which , sadly , is no parody , has more plot holes that pot holes on an old country road . the script by nelson demille , based on christopher bertolini's novel , is filled with cliched , unnatural lines . "" let me be blunt , "" the general tells paul . which one are you ? "" now given that every room is lit for maximum atmospherics and given that the editor has a propensity for constantly cutting to ominous choppers circling overhead , do you think something sinister might be going on ? do you think the general might be involved ? the general's daughter quickly degenerates to the sleazy level of the recent film 8mm . the most repugnant part of the story is the way in which it exploits rape and rape victims for lurid titillation . the director has little regard for the intelligence of the audience . every move is so telegraphed in advance that the film contains little genuine mystery . characters are so obviously either bad or good that the costume department might as well have passed out black hats to one group and white hats to the other . the killer , in particular , is quite easy to spot . even the usually reliable james woods doesn't lend any credibility or interest to the film . in the same way the actors disgrace themselves by being associated with such a ridiculous movie . most deliver decidedly subpar performances in a movie that is already in trouble because of the script and direction . perhaps they will be lucky and the movie will leave the theaters before anyone remembers it ever existed . it is rated r for strong sex , rape , sadomasochism , nudity , violence , and profanity . since it pushes the limit of the r rating , it should be considered acceptable only for the oldest and most mature teenagers .",0.3
"the piano is a film about passion , the most basic and primal element of human nature . no matter how thick the veneer of civilization is , or how deeply-buried beneath layers of social repression those latent emotions are , passion ultimately cannot be denied . this is something that the three principals of this movie learn in various , not-always-pleasant , ways . the piano has powerful emotional themes resonating through it , all dealing with the release of repressed passion . jane campion's story is often stirring and occasionally gut-wrenching ; the latter perhaps to a fault . there is a single visceral scene in this movie which becomes the most stark and enduring image taken from the theater . while definitely an expression of passion , this is perhaps not intended as the single defining moment of the piano , although it may be remembered as such . symbolism abounds , and most of it is clear enough for even the casual viewer to grasp . stewart's rejection of this , like baines' acceptance , defines the basis of who he is . the final scenes of the piano abound with symbols , the recognition of which will help in understanding all the facets of the ending . the three main actors give dazzling performances . to be able to convey this much energy and emotion without ever speaking a word ( except in a pair of short voiceovers ) requires someone of astonishing talent and ability . hunter's ada is every bit as powerful a presentation as anthony hopkins' stevens in the remains of the day . harvey keitel is as good , although the complexities of his character don't allow for quite as obvious a standout performance . sam neill has the most incomplete material to work from , but he does all he can with stewart . like their adult counterparts , child actors come with varying ranges of ability . while not in the category of a valentina scalici ( from il ladro di bambini , and who i have stated is the best child performer i have ever seen ) , ms . paquin is ultimately believable in her role , and a great asset to the film . as good as ms . campion's basic story is , both characterization and technical presentation are lacking . taken in tandem , these flaws prevent the piano from attaining its full potential . stewart never attains three-dimensionality , despite sam neill's best attempts , and baines is occasionally little more than a sounding board for ada's emotions to reverberate off of . flora's personality undergoes a radical shift that , at best , is only partially-motivated by what we see on screen . the editing of the piano is choppy , at times causing the narrative to seem disjointed or confusing . more than one transition is jarringly abrupt . there were several instances when my connection with the film was broken because of this . it's odd that , with a name like the piano , one of the weaknesses is the score . there are instances when michael nyman's themes are inappropriate for the scenes where they are used , and it has been pointed out to me that the new age strains coming from ada's instrument have no place during the time period in which the piano is supposed to have taken place . the piano is a good film with a potent message and occasional splashes of genius , but it is not remarkable experience , except perhaps where holly hunter's performance is concerned . while it's true that individuals will attribute different importance to the various flaws , there exists the distinct possibility that those going to see the piano with the expectation of watching the best movie of the year , will leave the theater disappointed .",0.79
"it is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along with being a film critic that , every once in a while , a film comes along which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle . critics are sometimes placed in the uncomfortable position of being expected to champion small , ennobling films simply because , like cinematic castor oil , they are good for us . we were colored is a film which wears its earnestness proudly on its sleeve ; it means well , and it tries hard . but a film has to have something more going for it than principle , and once upon a time . . . is a well-acted but extremely fragmented story which can't quite get its tone down straight . we were colored is not particularly interested in detailing the day-to-day ugliness of life in the segregated south ; it is a film about a kind of community which no longer exists , and as such it is occasionally quite touching . it is difficult not to watch scenes of 4th of july barbecues for which the whole town turns out , or to notice how the people of glen allan look out for each other , without feeling a sense of sadness that that unity had to disappear with the passing years . the main problem with once upon a time is that it makes frequent side trips to episodic stories which don't resonate , despite insistent voice-over narration ( provided by screenwriter paul w . cooper ) that tries to convince us that they should . the story allows for a scene in a backwater juke joint which adds a bit of atmosphere , but the relationship doesn't really matter , because there's a history there we haven't had a chance to see . there is an incompleteness to many of the individual episodes , and a lack of emotion to scenes which seem designed to provoke an emotional response . too often , however , the film drifts away from cliff's point-of-view , or injects an obligatory bit of racial violence almost because it seems to be expected . first-time feature director tim reid maintains a steady pace and evokes the atmosphere of his setting skillfully , but he doesn't find a narrative in the many stories he is trying to put on the screen . if its story and its characters had been as consistent as its good intentions , it might have been a great film .",0.5
"twenty years ago , a film like mad city would have been a provocative and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to feed our blood-lust . in fact , it was . . . it paddy chayefsky's brilliant script and peter finch's mesmerizing final performance as unraveling anchorman howard beale made network a classic of dark satire , spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit of ratings . it was just outrageous enough to be entertaining , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the notion that televison news isn't just about the news . . . well , it just isn't news . it never manages to arouse much more than nods of recognition , because the images and situations are familiar to the point of cliche : alda's self-important anchorman , the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined agenda , the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy . as an ethics lesson , it's strident but ineffective , preaching to a nation of converts about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct . it's fortunate , then , that mad city does a solid job of giving its subject a human face . that face doesn't belong to dustin hoffman , though brackett is the story's central character . playing simple challenges any actor , yet travolta plays simple with a disarming effectiveness . the relationship moments between baily and brackett are among the strongest in mad city , though it also provides a few chuckles as the public sympathies sway in the breeze . like most "" message "" films , however , it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message . mad city's primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character developments , of the plot progression , of the scolding tone the film takes towards its targets . it reaches an audience which doesn't find sensationalism disturbing , but it delivers its story as though no one else had told it before . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"it's an ambitious effort about how one can preserve one's dignity in the face of poverty . the picture tries to cover much territory , in this long epic-like , period-piece production of over two hours . it seems like a mess , as the film has too many stories going all at once and too many characters coming in and out of it to follow them all , and the acting is less than compelling . as a result , it is easy to lose track of the real-life figures for the cardboard symbols they represent , as the sides are drawn up -- the good guys are the struggling actors-and-the bad guys the industrial magnates . but , fortunately , the film rises to the occasion in its uplifting finale , bringing a renewed energy for its clear-cut message to be credibly received , at last . this is an old-fashioned liberal film , preaching its humanitarian message to the choir . the unfortunate thing about the film , is that it is not terribly entertaining . the film lumbered through by showing snippets of the theater rehearsals , introducing and then forgetting about a cast the size of an army . john adair ( sheridan ) is one of the actors who pushes her on-stage to get the part and he becomes her boyfriend , in a story that left me feeling unmoved , as it was just typical hollywood goo , seen many times before . the real-life characters from the theater group harldy fare better when portrayed : the bland marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) , who says he is not a communist but a homosexual ( but the point being made is that homosexuals are viewed just as badly as the commies are ) . they both gave forgettable performances . there are intertwined stories around the theater about the industrialists mixing with the fascists . these scenes could have been even more potently dramatic , if the miscast cusack was replaced by someone who could do a better rockefeller . at one point nelson says , "" i must confess that i'm more interested in the oil in paint than the oil in derricks . "" you've got to find a way to give them a dollar -- and take two ! "" vanessa redgrave , in a stereotyped role , is gray's lightheaded , titled wife , countess la grange , with liberal aspirations and sympathy for the theater people . all these parts seem oversimplified , with the director pulling the strings as if the actors were puppets , and though the message is right-on , there was no immediacy or impact in the story . there was no art in the art , everything moved along predictably . i imagine that someone with much more political savvy and more experience directing than robbins , like mike leigh , could have found a way to get around this mess without altering where the sympathies should lie to pull off a more satisfying work . the cast and the audience then trekked uptown through the streets and saw the show there . there was no scenery , there was just blitzstein at the piano , and the play made history with a most thrilling and memorable opening . but , ultimately , politics aside , the trouble with the original play became what was the trouble with this movie version , the story and the music are just too dry , though the message it presents , is worth savoring . but , any film that can quote nelson rockefeller and also leave no mistake where those other industrial patrons of the arts stood , makes me recommend this well-intentioned but flat dramatic film solely on that basis . ah !",0.5
"screenplay : bryan goluboff . director : scott kalvert . all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised "" featuring the music of . . .

"starring : liam neeson , ben kingsley , jonathan sagalle , caroline goodall , ralph fiennes , embeth davidtz director : steven spielberg producers : steven spielberg , gerald r . molen , branko lustig screenplay : steven zaillian based on the novel by thomas keneally music : john williams released by amblin entertainment through universal pictures steven spielberg has directed two of 1993's releases . one is the top money maker , and the other has a legitimate shot at winning the best picture oscar . even as fickle as the academy is , i find it hard to believe that spielberg will be overlooked this time . his holocaust tale is simply too good . there have been numerous documentaries and dramatic productions focusing on the holocaust , including a television mini-series which many consider to be the definitive work . as a result , in deciding to film schindler's list , the director set for himself an imposing task . those who see this motion picture will witness spielberg's success . for a while , there is no interest and nothing happens . spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white , and it's impossible to argue with his decision . having viewed the movie thus , it's impossible to imagine it any other way . director of photography janusz kaminski has made beautiful use of shadow and light . in much the same way that it's cinematic blasphemy to suggest colorizing citizen kane , so it's impossible to imagine schindler's list in anything but black-and-white . that's not to say that there's no color in this movie , but its use is kept to a premium . when color is used , it's noticeable , and spielberg has definite reasons for utilizing it . schindler's list gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones . these are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed , and spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the situation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore . his eventual lament that he couldn't save more is heartbreaking . goeth is a man to despise , but spielberg works carefully to show enough character depth to paint him with narrower brush strokes that show more than a conscienceless monster . in many ways , the smaller stories are the best parts of schindler's list , and these often provide the most lasting images . of course the holocaust images are grim , but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to schindler's list . while it's impossible to deny their power , potentially more distubing are the instances of callous , individual murder . spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events . schindler's list is replete with moments like this . yet despite the grisly background , this movie is essentially a story of triumph in the midst of a monstrous tragedy . not a happy story , to be sure , but one that offers a glimmer of hope . the acting is uniformly excellent ; there's not a bad performance in evidence . this is no sudden reversal of philosophy , but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man . with skill and a keen sense of schindler's character , neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to crusader . ben kingsley , whose gandhi transfixed audiences years ago , may have the most understated role in the movie . his is not a flashy part , but it's as essential as neeson's to the story , and he plays it with simple sincerity . there's much more that could--and eventually will--be said about schindler's list . this is the kind of movie that's ripe for discussion . not only is the quality of the production high , but the picture is pregnant with meaning and memories . however , at least for now , i've said enough . this is a movie that speaks for itself anyway , with its images being far more eloquent and gut-wrenching than anything i could write . one-hundred ninety five minutes ( the running length of schindler's list ) is a long time , but it's hard to imagine anyone being aware of the time while watching this film . and when the final credits have rolled , this won't be an experience easily shunted aside or forgotten .",0.96
"director : tim burton . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , brief sexual situations ) . running time : 105 minutes reviewed by scott renshaw . i really wanted mars attacks ! to be the movie independence day wasn't . tim burton's malevolent alien invasion saga faces such obvious comparisons to 1996's other malevolent alien invasion saga that it would have been a pleasure to find that this one was the little b-movie homage that could , juxtaposed with the big b-movie re-tread that couldn't . i came ready for delight , and instead i found disappointment . is a more inventive film than independence day , but it is also a sluggish one , in addition to having a surprising streak of nastiness . if you didn't know mars attacks ! what is surprising is that these stories are played so straight , and with nearly as little character development as independence day . pierce brosnan and sarah jessica parker are entertaining as the unctuous kessler and a dim fashion reporter , respectively , but their appearance is most memorable because they share a tender love scene as severed heads . that moment highlights what is both best and worst about mars attacks ! , which is the perverse visual humor . burton tosses out some truly twisted gems along with just-plain-silliness , and the deliberately cheesy visual effects are both effective on their own and as a source for an internal joke involving a godzilla film . the problem is that nothing really builds in mars attacks ! ; the jokes are often stand-alone vignettes un-related to anything which precedes them or anything which follows them , making for a film which jerks along unsteadily with little momentum . is based on a series of trading cards by topps , and appropriately enough that is the way the movie feels : you flip over one scene , chuckle at it , then forget it almost before you flip over the next one . the one thing burton and screenwriter jonathan gems do much better than independence day is allow us to get to know the aliens , and what a bunch of leering interplanetary sociopaths they are . the scenes on board the flying saucers show the martians' delight at duping humanity and wreaking havoc , and while the malicious martians provide their share of laughs , the whole concept is strangely mean-spirited . burton almost seems to share this smirking disregard for his characters ( and an unexplainable hatred of birds ) as he reduces them to scorched skeletons in scenes which may be too graphic for youngsters . there is plenty of imagination in mars attacks ! ( the aliens' downfall certainly does not involve a computer virus ) , but the ideas prickle rather than tickle . something seemed to be annoying tim burton when he made mars attacks ! , and he's probably going to be more annoyed if audiences decide it isn't the movie independence day was .",0.5

"most science fiction movies , good or bad , have a single look and set of characters that they use throughout the entire production . but not luc besson's the fifth element . every five minutes , some totally new character or special effect is introduced . this makes for a highly involving and mesmerizing film . although the film is incorrectly being marketed as the "" star wars for the 90s , "" it does have some of the imagination of the star wars saga . where it differs , is that the fifth element never takes itself very seriously . the current trend among filmmakers is to engage in a battle with the studio's finance department with the filmmakers' goal being to spend the maximum amount possible on special effects . the fifth element puts some sanity in this trend by spending every penny wisely , producing some of the most dazzling effects in a long time . if you are envisioning a depressing blade runner motif for besson's vision , think again . typical of the innovativeness is its rendering of traffic in a big city in the year 2259 . rather than heavy traffic on the one street level , the airborne cars operate on numerous but carefully controlled parallel logical surfaces . among all of the visual spectacles is a story and some excellent acting as well . bruce willis , who can be terrific but has been in so many dogs like color of night that i have begun to dread seeing his name on the marquee , plays the starring role of the taxi driver and ex-government agent korben dallas . she speaks only a sing-song style of language that baffles korben . the screenplay by luc besson and robert mark kamen has enough complexity to make following it somewhat of a challenge , but never so much as to lose the audience . working through it becomes an interesting diversion , but all eyes stay glued to the screen to see what will happen next . the fifth element is more a feast for the eyes than the mind . the film is filled with cartoonish shoot-'em-up violence , willis , as one of many shooters , plays a much more lovable character than he does in the die hard series . his enjoyment of his character transfers easily to the audience . the chemistry between korben and his sidekick leeloo pulsates with comedic and romantic energy . me protect you .

"it's the era of e-mail , call waiting , answering machines , and cellular phones -- a time when impersonal communication has replaced interpersonal communication . at least that's how hal salwen presents things in denise calls up , and , for a certain segment of the population , salwen's scenario doesn't exaggerate much . if talking on the telephone is a weak surrogate for real human contact , then the men and women of denise calls up are seriously deprived . none of them ever congregate . whole relationships begin , climax , and end without either of the parties ever knowing what the other looks like . one of the problems with denise calls up is that it takes its excesses to excess . as intriguing as the premise is , i'm not sure it can support a feature-length movie ( even one as short as eighty minutes ) , and the second half of denise calls up ( with the exception of a riotous conference call ) is far less fresh than the first half . in addition , salwen's presentation is often cynical , sometimes bordering on cruel , and this attitude makes it difficult for viewers to care about the characters . the last scene rings hollow because the people involved don't mean that much to us . on the other hand , there's no doubt that salwen conveys his message . denise calls up isn't a vacuous comedy -- it has something to say , and the humor , some of which is quite funny , represents salwen's method of preaching . special mention should also be made of editor gary sharfin's work . denise calls up is light enough that it doesn't demand much range from the performers , all of whom are fine for their roles . the actors do their best to mold likable characters , but sometimes the script's glibness defeats them . so , while salwen has formed an interesting portrait of modern social interaction , his cynicism works against the movie's success . denise calls up might have been more effective if the writer/director had taken the time to create characters imbued with more than token traces of humanity . as things stand , everyone in this film is little more than a voice on the other end of the phone .",0.65
"it's always good around halloween to have one really bad horror movie to look forward to . alas , this year's lone october horror release , thinner , falls considerably short of the level of awfulness established by last year's halloween 6 . while this latest adaptation of a stephen king novel doesn't approach "" good "" film making , it's at least watchable ( if just barely ) -- a quality that no one would ascribe to the most recent chapter of the unbearably moronic michael myers saga . there are two kinds of movies based on stephen king stories -- the dramas ( stand by me , the shawshank redemption ) and the horrors ( pet sematary , the mangler ) . in general , the former are quite good while the latter are terrible . so , since thinner falls somewhere between genres , it's fitting that the film's quality is also somewhere in the middle . thinner is a rather shallow and unsatisfactory examination of some potentially-worthwhile themes and ideas . equally unfortunately , it's not at all scary . ( maybe he should consult with arnold schwarzenegger , star of this summer's eraser . ) unfortunately , questions of morality are of secondary importance to a film that emphasizes its death wish aspects . the most energetic parts of thinner are those that focus on billy's revenge , and this is no accident . the makeup that transforms 175-pound robert john burke into his 300-pound character is embarrassingly unconvincing , especially in the wake of the much better job done to expand eddie murphy's waistline in the nutty professor . for that matter , the prosthetics on michael constantine and several other actors don't look all that impressive , either . on top of its other problems , thinner is too long . there's not enough story here for a forty-five minute motion picture , not to mention something twice that length . as a result , there's a lot of pointless running around , a protracted dream sequence , and some meaningless "" character building "" scenes that don't build anything . on the whole , though , a slimmer running time , not to mention an astute script , would have made thinner go down a lot more smoothly .",0.4
"but in robert altman's gentle and perceptive comedy , this is not enough . appropriately enough , this is a film set in the fall , and the mood and the color of the film reflects that time of year , in all its beauty and in its surprisingly stormy weather . she is baffled by her problem , but surmises it's a rare mythological complex that she suffers from , that affects only upper-class women who are loved too much and come to reject this love , retreating into a childlike state . she concurs that if anyone would know , it's him . at last , after many recent bombs , gere has found a film that goes hand in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace , as he plays a sympathetic character , someone who seems very comfortable with this dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and a generous person who is trying his best to be the man around a sea of women . there doesn't seem to be much tragedy here , it seems that script writer anne rapp and the 75-year-old altman are only gently chiding the doctor for thinking he can ever understand women , and the film plays more like a big joke on him than anything else . what unravels for him , are all things he can easily rebound from , as the film ends with the song "" ain't it something the way things go "" being played as the credits roll by , after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film .",0.6
"disney's recent movie called flubber -- an underrated film that critics , except me , generally loathed but kids loved -- is a remake of the absent-minded professor starring fred macmurray as professor ned brainard . after seeing and liking robin williams in flubber , our family decided to check out the original . the original's simple humor looks remarkably tired compared with the story's energetic and much more inventive remake . moreover , the performances in the original , except those of fred macmurray and keenan wynn , as the villain alonzo hawk , are wooden . the professor's intended , nancy olson , for example , is played lethargically by betsy carlisle in the original . and although macmurray did a fine job , williams brought much more to the role . then again , weebo , the professor's companion in the remake outclasses poor charlie and garners an order of magnitude more laughs . the question confronting the professor , and the script writers , is "" what can you do with flubber ? "" in both film versions , the substance is used in a basketball game and as an alternative fuel for the professor's car . john hughes did the script for flubber , based on the original script by bill walsh and the book by samuel w . taylor . in the remake they simply find many more imaginative and comical things to do with flubber , not the least of which is a magical , synchronized dance number . even the parts that are the same in the two versions are so much more realistic , funny , and involving in flubber . even the simplest things are done particularly poorly in the original . the sounds effects during the big basketball game sound less like a real crowd than a swarm of droning bees . the talky comedy has less humor than it should and relatively few sight gags , amazing given the possibilities of flying rubber . the visuals of the flying tin lizzie are sweet , and the ending , where they finally put the bad guy in his place , does have the imagination that the rest of the picture too often lacks . although it is a genuinely charming comedy , the absent-minded professor is that rare original movie that made me yearn for its remake . it is not rated , but would be a g and is suitable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thoughts it was a "" really good movie .

"i am sorry to report that tim burton has decided to make a third batman movie , batman forever . this is the first one that he did not direct although he did produce it . for director he tapped joel schumacher , whose only halfway decent film was the client . this time we have chris o'donnell playing dick grayson - robin . the plot , you ask ? why do you ask ? if you have seen one batman , you have seen them all . i will not cover the plot as its existence is irrelevant . one sees batman to sneer at the villains and watch all of the gadgetry and stunts . almost every scene requires the suspension of disbelief in order to watch it . the script is full of one liners that end in "" ha ha ha "" just to make sure that you know it is supposed to be a joke . moreover , the director has the actors get all wild eyed to make absolutely sure you know it is a joke . perhaps , batman has always been this way , but the style has outlined ability to charm or interest an audience . the audience in the theater i was at had about as much interest in the movie as val kilmer did , which is almost none . he sleepwalked through most of the movie . even at that , his performance was much better than kidman's who was unable to demonstrate she could act at all , and based on her previous movies , i would say the jury is still out on that question anyway . the sets by barbara ling and the cinematography by stephen goldblatt were in the usual dark and foreboding batman style . granted they were not as sinister as in batman or batman returns , nevertheless , they were pretty depressing . i understand that robin williams was offered the role of the riddler , but tim burton got frustrated when williams would not make up his mind if he wanted to take the part or not and gave it to carrey instead out of frustration . frankly , i think williams's style of humor would have enlivened the show some , and i am sorry he did not agree to do the part . batman forever seemed liked it ran forever . the editing by dennis virkler was fast paced , but had too much material at 2 : 00 . i was bored from the beginning . it is correctly rated pg-13 for comic violence and sexual references . i would not let kids under 13 see it , but there were a fair number of 8 year olds and above in the audience when i saw it . i do not recommend the movie , and i award it a single star solely for the gadgets . i hope tim burton realizes that the batman formula is tired , and it is time to bury it . i do hope that next year we do not have batman ad nauseam as yet another blockbuster attempt . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.3
"in this movie , that goes beyond the boundaries of what a movie is , because it has become a trademark name that is as easily recognized as any popular brand name is ; if i mentioned kfc , you would know that i am talking about a fast-food chain that sells fried chicken ( ugh ! ) , and if i mentioned star wars ( ah ! ) , the same familiarity would ring a bell with you . since the movie first surfaced in 1977 , it has been a very popular film , basically over-taking many other types of films that took on the moral battle of good and evil , such as the western , and it created a new myth that does not challenge the old myth , but incorporates pieces of mythology not only from the judeo-christian roots of the bible , but from the eastern religions , as well . it has become so commercially successful a film and enterprise , that even though the film cost about 115 million dollars to make , its profit margin is a sure thing , since it has merchandise deals tied into its release , that are estimated to be around 3 . 5 billion dollars . with this in mind , there can be no ordinary viewing of this film , since it is already hyped and promoted beyond any reasonable level of expectation , it is therefore hardly likely that it could meet such expectations , even with its fanatical fan base , willing to stand on long lines for a long time in order to get tickets and who will most likely see the film a number of a times , and a public that is primed and ready for the product . how many times will viewers want to see it , is hard to gauge at this early date , though what is guaranteed , is that it will draw large crowds and pump life into the movie industry , as many will see this film as an event , therefore making it critic-proof and ensured of being a legendary film no matter what might be perceived of it on screen . what takes place on screen , if i can consider myself , a voice of moderation on this subject , is not as terrible a storyline and acting job as one could be led to believe by listening to some film critics , nor is it as great a film as many unabashed fans might think , who feel taken with the innovative special-effects , and are really caught up in the aura and excessive exuberance the total film's package presents to them , from john william's recognizable star war themes , to some original musical scores he added , as special for the film . there should be something in this film for everybody to like , especially in a thx theater , where the digital sound system and wide screen is best suited for viewing it . the tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project , makes it seem stupendous at times , and , even throughout the film , when there are lulls in its story , it still sets a very galactic mood , that is trance-like and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense , but it does suffer , at times , from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters , and is scripted with a banal dialogue , plus there is no romance in it , which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience , an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth . as a positive feature of the film , it is not interested in gratuitous violence , and for that it scores high marks , as there is no blood in it , as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled . the pace of the film picks up with its most innovative addition , an exciting and , i might add , dizzying racing sequence featuring "" pod "" space ships , as ani has to win the race to gain freedom for himself and for the jedis to get their needed space craft parts , as a wager is made with ani's junkman boss on the pod race . this is pure video game stuff , that should thrill its younger audience , perhaps more than it did me , but it was effective and added something new to the star wars legend . delving into the evil nature of politics , there is the dual role played by ian mcdiarmid , as senator palpatine/darth sidious , cast perfectly as a shadowy villain and a hypocritical senator , who in future episodes will become emperor palpatine and should provide more chills for viewer's to reckon with . without its frightening villains , star wars would be stripped of its soul . some of the actors did not impress me enough as the above mentioned . it is probably not fair and not nice to criticize a youngster like jake lloyd who plays anakin skywalker , but i thought , that though he was sometimes bearable to see on the screen , as when he played with his computer toys , he was , nevertheless , miscast and did not have the skills to pull off the difficult role he was asked to fulfill . anikin's mother , the great swedish actress , pernilla august , is just right for the part ; in fact , she is too good for the part , because she makes the boy seem very amateurish and not caring enough when he is teamed with her and can't respond with the proper emotional responses expected from his role , while she is fluid and graceful in her role , even though she is stuck in a wooden part . there were non-distinguished cameos by samuel l . jackson and terrence stamp , that have neither added nor distracted anything from the film . i would have preferred seeing unknown actors in those minor roles , giving them a chance to get known and earn some "" bread . "" some of the more exciting scenes , that weren't crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo lucas could throw at us , so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption , came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets , such as the submerged underwater city on naboo , filled with dangerous sea monsters , and a coliseum-like stadium on tatooine , where the "" pod race "" transpired , covered by talking head sport's personalities . its soaring skyscrapers and a sky filled with exotic spaceships and its views of the world , that was just too stunning to fully grasp . all these space landscapes gave the film all the color and spectacle it could ever need , making it a most entertaining and enjoyable movie experience , which is really what this movie is all about anyway , since i find it difficult to get too worked up over its so called "" new mythology , "" joseph campbell blessed or not , since this movie only expresses what is just a shell of what myths can mean to a society . be that it as it may , i do understand that many feel that what is missing in today's society , is some kind of positive myth , that there is something that has gone wrong with our culture , and this film does offer some encouragement for those who feel movies have caused a certain amount of degeneracy in this country's cultural war , and they should be pleased that lucas's film reasserts , his personal belief , that good can triumph over evil , as many feel restless and unsure about the world they live in and need reassurance that we have the same positive values other generations of americans have had , and they should look forward to seeing a film such as this one , that has such a rosy outlook . it is a movie about the taming of nature in the future but made for the age we live in , and will be remembered by future movie viewers , not for its trite dialogue , but as a step up the ladder in our technical and computer skills , and in our deep yearnings to find hope in the world we live in . it seems regretable that we have to wait three more years for the next installment of these episodes to be released . i would say that this imperfect film , is still , a not-to-be missed film , and even if it has become tied-in with corporate america , nevertheless , george lucas used his great technical skills to make this film as artistically good looking as he could , not aiming to make an exploitive film . and for that , we should all be grateful . i have immensely enjoyed the film for what it was and was not overly concerned about what it was not . i think it is fair to say , that when you plunk down your money and see this film , you will be getting your money's worth .

"starring : sihung lung , chien-lien wu , kuie-mei yang , yu-wen wang , ah-leh gua , jui wang , winston chao . screenplay : hui-ling wang , james schamus and ang lee . director : ang lee . issues of quality aside , this is the best advice i can give to anyone considering seeing ang lee's eat drink man woman : do * not * see it on an empty stomach . also like that earlier film , it is about much more than recipes . eat drink man woman , like lee's oscar-nominated 1993 film the wedding banquet , is a story of generational conflict , a witty and emotionally involving tale in which food plays a pivotal role in observations on a changing chinese culture . eat drink man woman also explores romantic relationships in this context of generational change , and there it is less consistently successful . each of the four main characters is given a subplot , and like old chu's dinners the film begins to seem like there is a bit too much to consume in one sitting . the youngest daughter's story is particularly weak , and the film might have been more effective if her character had been dropped entirely . otherwise , solid acting makes for some affecting stories . sihung lung , so good as the father in the wedding banquet , is again taciturn without being one-note , and provides a solid anchor for the film . the best story belongs to kuei-mei yang's jia-jen , and she does a magnificent job of playing all of jia-jen's buried emotions at just the right level . i was not a huge fan of the wedding banquet ; i felt it was inconsistently paced , and that its weak lead performances hindered its emotional pull . though it runs a bit long , eat drink man woman is a warm and keenly observed character piece , filled with mostly exceptional performances . see it as it makes its way to your town .",0.8
"with eerie old paintings , large human-like sculptures and creepy corridors , the house looks remarkably like disneyland's haunted mansion . the main difference in the two edifices is that disneyland's is comically frightening , whereas the haunting's is neither comical nor frightening . over-the-top action director jon de bont relegates the human stars to minor roles . since all of their performances are embarrassing , this is perhaps to their advantage . ironically , de bont's claim to fame is speed . most of the haunting appears to be on a quite different drug , valium . the tedium is more likely to bore you to death than scare you with its expensive special effects . only in the outlandish last part does the pacing pick up . as the story slowly advances , the house displays some of its charms . in canonical horror movie fashion , doors come alive and spirits move about . most of the time , however , the movie relies on lots of low base rumbling . the effects on audiences are likely to be profoundly muted . the movie works only if you can ignore how serious the participants are taking it and assume it must be a parody . the problem with this approach is that it's just not funny . "" this is so twisted , seriously twisted , "" theodora says . no theodora , it isn't , and therein lies the problem . the film is a lame retread of a hundred other similar horror movies , only the budget is larger . maybe de bont should have attempted something more challenging , say a shot-for-shot reconstruction of gus van sant's psycho ? the haunting runs a long 2 : 05 . it is rated pg-13 for intense horror sequences and would be acceptabe for kids 12 and up .",0.3
"this certainly isn't the first motion picture to focus on father/daughter bonding , nor will it be the last . but i'll do anything has the distinction of being enjoyable and entertaining , while bringing a new twist or two to an old subject . not everything works out quite as expected , and that's the biggest element of the movie's charm , because these days it's usually too easy to predict what's coming next . kids in movies generally come in one of two categories : sickeningly cute or terminally annoying . there are a few scenes where she fails to convince , but far more in which she's entirely believable . if ms . wright avoids the "" culkin syndrome "" , she could have a bright future . as always , nick nolte is the consummate professional , and his supporting cast is equally solid . this isn't a unique role , but mr . brooks acts the part with gusto . i'll do anything is blessed with a wonderful screenplay that shares equal parts drama and comedy . the emotional texture is surprisingly firm , especially as it relates to matt and jeannie , but there are plenty of laughs to be had . much of the script works because it rarely strays from the commonplace . since the audience can therefore relate to the characters and their situations , the movie has an impact . those scenes that go over-the-top , such as the incident with jeannie running around screaming on an airplane , come across as silly and unnecessary . i'll do anything presents similar themes to those developed in , among other projects , the player , the big picture , and mistress . the satire isn't as biting because the overall intention is to create a human interest story rather than a cynical look at a jaded industry ripe for parody . movies about parent/child relationships are usually riddled with formulas . however , while james brooks' project occasionally allows a too-pat resolution to slip by , there are a few minor surprises . i'll do anything can justifiably boast a freshness and intelligence too often absent from motion pictures . just take a look at my father the hero for an example of how a film can take a similar idea and completely botch it . the greatest strength of i'll do anything isn't difficult to pinpoint--it has immense appeal . not only is the movie well-scripted and competently-acted , but it presents its characters in such a way that the audience can feel for them without being aware of overt manipulation . mr . brooks , the director of such films as broadcast news and terms of endearment , has delivered a rare jewel in the bleakness of february's movie wasteland . i'll do anything may have started out life as a failed musical , but with judicious edits and re-shoots , it has become a thoroughly enjoyable dramatic comedy .",0.72

"before i start lambasting this motion picture , let me recap my feelings about the french film upon which jungle 2 jungle is based . little indian , big city ( a . k . a . , un indien dans la ville ) was easily one of 1996's worst films -- a dull , lifeless attempt to cull laughs from dumb characters doing stupid things in contrived situations . not for one moment was it cute , funny , or likable . the predictable result is a bad movie -- the kind of pointless tripe that the mouse company continues to foist upon us in the name of "" family entertainment .

"kicking and screaming is a good , but too frequently trite movie about the superficiality and meaninglessness of young people's lives today . it is being billed as a droll comedy , but it really isn't . the movie at its best is an insightful satire on young adulthood . i laughed a couple of times , but more often i was either touched by the dialog or just bored . first time writer and director noah baumbach assembled a cast of typical college kid looking actors and actresses . most have been in other shows about generation xers that either i have never seen or that i hated , i . e . , shows like naked in new york or amateurs . none had been in the absolutely wonderful before sunrise which is proof positive that shows about people in their 20s can be both well made and not depressing . one semester skip takes only : ethics , scandinavian literature , and personality . finally , elliott gould , an actor who was never very good , is a complete embarrassment in this movie as grover's dad . weird . the movie has way too many failed attempts at sight gags . baumbach should have concentrated on the dialog which is the high point of the show and given up on the sight gags . baumbach's dialog ranges from the insightful to the bizarre . although the guys and gals hang out a lot , none of them have more than a superficial interest in each other or in life itself for that matter . i found this part of the movie believable but incredibly sad . the kids smoke a lot , and drink all of the time . i am sorry to report that movie seems to say that you can drink scotch and colt 45 malt liquor with one large swig after another , and yet never get mush mouthed , stumble , or have it in any way affect your body or your behavior . since the film is clearly targeted at the 12-29 age groups , it is freighting that this movies trivializes alcoholism so much . most kids in the show have major drinking problems that the picture makes almost invisible . other than the two pieces of terrible acting mentioned previously , the other actors and actresses were good . eric stoltz who needs good direction to be effective got it from baumbach . here he was the best person in the cast . the almost sepia colored photography by steven bernstein and the depressing and lifeless costumes by mary jane fort add to the overall moroseness of the show . it is a technique that works well at focusing the audience's attention on the character's expression . kicking and screaming runs a quick 1 : 34 thanks to editing by julie dole . if you let your teenagers go , go with them if you can and talk about the movie afterwards , especially the drinking , the smoking , and the real reasons for going to college . this could be a good opportunity to open up some communication with them . i found myself touched by the movie , and although baumbach's film showed a lot of potential , too much was unrealized for me to be able to recommend it . i give the movie my average movie rating of * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : november 11 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.5
"the beach , directed by danny boyle ( trainspotting ) , is an entertaining , but not especially original , adventure yarn . the film works as a star vehicle for leonardo dicaprio , but the rest of the casting is singularly uninspired . the easy to cast role of the alluringly gorgeous french woman , for example , is given to virginie ledoyen , who looks and acts particularly bland . still , as a travelogue from hell , the picture does have its charms . even at its most enjoyable , the film loses a certain amount of credibility from the sense of d ? j ? vu that it evokes . if it were better than some of the movies that it imitates , this might not be a problem , but there isn't a scene which isn't stronger in the original . most people would beat a hasty retreat at this point , but not our hedonists . would you be willing to risk your life to get to it ? now , be honest , don't you think you can guess the rest of the movie ? well , you can . think that the commune's peaceful coexistence with the dope growers will last ? see , you could have written the screenplay . some of boyle's staging choices are particularly surprising . and the star is french no less . richard's rich narration is one of the film's chief allures along with its gorgeous scenery and dreamy music .

"the commercials for in the mouth of madness remind us that john carpenter is the man behind arguably the best modern horror film , halloween . however , despite what the marketeers might wish us to believe , the pictures have little in common except for a few well-orchestrated scares . halloween was creepy , atmospheric , cunningly scripted , and frightening . in the mouth of madness is confusing , weird , and not very involving . it's easy to sit back and impassively be impressed by some of what in the mouth of madness attempts to do . without gratuitous sex or gore , the film works to create an intelligent horror experience that mixes nightmares , reality , and fantasy . this is a tactic employed by the far better wes craven's last nightmare , and here it feels a bit like a retread . also , in pursuit of all his nifty ideas and mind-bending twists , writer michael de luca forgot to fashion believable characters . despite a magnificently-entertaining performance by sam neill , his john trent never really connects on any level with the audience . in trying to be inventive and unique , the story occasionally manages instead to annoy and confuse . there's too much of the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream and other similar stuff going on . a little of this might have created a nice sense of ambiguity , but carpenter overdoes it . as a result , his story gets buried too deeply beneath the overriding question of whether trent is real and insane or a fictional character who's the only one aware of what's going on . at this point , we're reminded of sleepy castle rock in needful things . admittedly , an intellectual horror story is infinitely preferable to a gory slasher flick , but in the mouth of madness falls a step short of being a worthy entry . the final , missing ingredient--whether it's a hero we can really root for , a more engaging script , or a better actress as linda--leaves carpenter's latest firmly grounded in mediocrity . and , looking back to halloween , we know he's capable of rising far above that . maybe his next film , a remake of village of the damned , will remind us of the kind of great horror the director can give us .",0.57
"matthew harrison's "" kicked in the head "" has its offbeat comical moments but in the end dies from self-indulgence and too much cuteness . kevin corrigan wrote a juicy part for himself , but his part never caught fire , in fact , he was the film's weakness . the supporting characters were at least funny when they did their shticks in this rambling , derivative nyc movie , that tried too hard to be offbeat and in the process forgot it would be nice to have a story that made some sense to go with the film . when she does that , it is good for a few laughs . the film gets trapped in too many scenes that don't work . another is the unlikely romance taking place between corrigan and fiorentino , which seemed out of context , and added nothing to the story , except it was more pleasant watching fiorentino perform than it was in watching corrigan . she was so much better than him , that it made me scratch my head and wonder what he was doing there . her character was all the more compelling than his , even though she had such a small part . nothing seemed to really work well here , yet all the supporting characters seemed to be pleasant and trying their best to make things work . but the film was too much of a childish fantasy on the part of corrigan , and the dialogue was too flip . it was one of those films that you might find enjoyable if you are in the right frame of mind for watching actors improvise their way out of a bad script , or if you are stoned like the connoisseur participants in "" ape "" film conversation were .",0.4
"an amazingly strange film , confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable , but a film i found more interesting than i thought possible at first viewing . this experimental film in minimalist story telling , a film consisting of disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue , had a concept that was greater than how the film turned out . it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women . the film uses its impressions of the marine base as a metaphor for the social violence in today's american society , and to give it its startling look of reality , marines were used as the actors . the plot is simple . the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words . because the film had no linear story and followed no chronological order , and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is filmed , it appeared surreal . i thought these additions seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext . the unsettling milieu in which the crime took place , speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken place . the film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what we've seen . though the film was dull and did not move me while i was watching it , it did something to me afterwards intellectually , it made me think of a military base , the persian gulf war , and of marital abuse , but it made me think of them without the usual concepts i bring to my thinking cap . does that make this a great film ? no . but it makes it an interesting one , a film that i can't easily dismiss . its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence . here it is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but , perhaps , one doesn't really understand or want to understand what evil society has created .",0.6
"heavy on village minutia ( washing dishes , baking bread , riding motorbikes and playing boom boxes ) , the film lacks anything approaching a compelling narrative . the best that could be said of it is that , with its visual splendor , it could be dramatically trimmed down and made into a dynamite travelogue . the movie's central character is a gentle , 64-year-old kirgiz woman , who looks at least a decade older . the film generally eschews dialog and is composed instead with long silent sections involving simple village life , much like the documentary endurance . this can have a sleep-inducing effect on the audience . the miners , however , seem to be the happiest of all , so the message about progress destroying the local culture doesn't acquire much traction . american movies featuring animals are obliged to include a disclaimer in the closing credits stating that no animals were harmed during the making of the film . among the few scenes of any dramatic tension in the movie are a couple of sickening ones involving goats . to be fair , the documentary didn't cause these events to occur . it just recorded them . the film is in english and kirgiz with english subtitles . it is not rated but might be an r for the above-mentioned animal sequences . the film would be acceptable for teenagers .",0.4

"director : tim burton . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . watching sleepy hollow , you realize that tim burton could have made a definitive masterwork about the headless horseman . . . if anyone had given him a script that was actually about the headless horseman . changing source material -- even radically changing source material -- is nothing new in hollywood , so it's not terribly surprising to find only a passing resemblance between the film and washington irving's classic ghost story . there is plenty of splendid , grisly entertainment in burton's brand of quirky gothic horror , but it's bogged down in a story that's a cross between a parlor mystery and an episode of "" scooby doo . "" from its very first moments , sleepy hollow shows tremendous promise . here he's an eccentric revelation as the big city rationalist coping with supernatural phenomena . depp has a ridiculous amount of fun with crane's prissiness , and burton gets lots of mileage out of spraying him with blood . burton gets even more mileage out of the spectacular look of sleepy hollow , from the twisted woods to the gloomy town . he nails the spooky side of the story , combining effective action with flying body parts a-plenty whenever the headless horseman is at the center of the narrative . unfortunately , he's not at the center of the narrative nearly often enough . eventually , the film becomes focused on crane's efforts to understand the connection between the victims and who might be controlling the horseman . i wonder who might possibly care . the question of the head behind the headless horseman not only becomes an irritating distraction -- and means you can count on a tedious expository scene of the villain explaining his/her plan in excruciating detail -- it robs the horseman of too much power . andrew kevin walker's script ( tweaked by tom stoppard ) turns a primally frightening apparition into little more than hired muscle from beyond the grave . i suppose that one glaring misstep is so troubling because sleepy hollow has so much going for it as one of burton's typically grim fairy tales . between the delights of depp's performance and the dark enchantment of the production design , it's easy to start feeling the potential for brilliance . you only need to feel the energy level rise when the horseman is on screen to understand that detective work didn't really belong in this story . sleepy hollow may be somebody's idea of "" fleshing out "" washington irving's story , but what it really needed was less flesh and more ectoplasm . burton has made a wonderful monster movie from a script that doesn't understand this is a monster movie . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.7
"he was just twenty-nine years- old and had made two brilliant feature films , zero conduct and this film . l'atalante is , perhaps , considered by some , a dated film as far as its style goes . but with that being said , there is no denying that it is still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition . the ordinary couple are playing out their vexing emotions without letting on how much these emotions mean to them , until it is almost too late . because their emotions and passions are so dominating , the quality of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state . the seine looks so much like a dreamworld , where those on it are just drifting . because the story is such a simple one and the couple in so ordinary , it is not the story in itself that is exhilerating , as much as the way the film moves us to look at our own lives , with all its possibilities and disappointments . it makes us see things in a way that is disarmingly enchanting . that despite the moroseness and daily grind of regular life , there is also a poetical and romantic mood , waiting to be tapped . we makes his film an out-of-this world cinematic experience that sublimely lingers in our consciousness . the film version to see , which is now on video , is the restored 1990 one , that pierre philippe and jean-louis bompoint recovered missing footage for . the film is now more decipherable from the botched up initial showing of the film , that was not well received by the paris audience . it is good to see vigo's almost original version of the film resurrected , at last , and look so stunningly beautiful in black-and-white .",0.9
"starring : charlton heston , sofia loren , john fraser , genevieve page , herbert lom director : anthony mann producer : samuel bronston screenplay : frederic m . frank and philip yordan music : miklos rozsa re-released by miramax films and martin scorsese "" el cid is one of the greatest epic films ever made . lavish praise from martin scorsese , one of the forces behind the restoration and re-release of el cid . pardon me if i am not wholly in agreement with him . el cid is definitely not a good source for a factual biography ( the identity of diaz' wife and the premise of the finale are a few of the more obvious occasions when the truth is completely ignored ) . using similar methods and equal care to that which was given to lawrence of arabia , the restoration of el cid is an impressive undertaking . the sound quality on this new print is flawless and , for the most part , the picture is better than one would expect from a thirty-two year old film . there are several frames that are far from mint condition , but the overall effect is impressive , and the colors are never washed-out . the battle scenes of el cid are breathtaking , and well worth the effort of seeing on a large screen . video viewing of the climactic struggle would greatly diminish the impact , and it is in this context that it's possible to understand scorsese's quote . this is definitely a film meant for theaters . the television screen will serve only to limit the high points and magnify the numerous , often-glaring weaknesses . instead of el cid seeming like an epic , it could come off looking rather stupid . that's because beyond the spectacle and pageantry , el cid's virtues are limited . the costumes and set design are as impressive as the magnificent backdrops against which the turbulent struggles of the armies occur , and the effort necessary to orchestrate the realistic clash of thousands of swords is mind-boggling , but while these things add a great deal to the film , they cannot entirely cover up its shortcomings . acting is by far the biggest problem . while both charlton heston and sofia loren have imposing screen personalities , neither is capable of projecting real emotion or drawing us into a rapport with the characters . simply put , heston and loren are wooden , and there are only a few occasions on which they manage to make diaz or chimene real . the chemistry between them is flat , conveying little , if any , passion . "" smouldering "" is not a word anyone would use to describe this couple . the plot is high melodrama with few surprises . el cid turns far more often to the ridiculous than the sublime , and the last scenes contain an element that is downright silly . perhaps if the movie didn't take itself so seriously , there wouldn't be as many opportunities for unintentional laughter , but el cid is about as self-important as a motion picture can be . it is an epic , after all , but in case we've forgotten , there's always the needlessly florid dialogue and stentorian score to remind us . obviously , they don't make movies like this any more , and that's both good and bad . while there's a lot in this film that modern pictures don't need to harken back to , it would be nice to see some of the flair . when recalling great battles in recent films , only a few come to mind ( last of the mohicans and glory , for example ) , none of which have the scope or sheer power of what anthony mann achieved in el cid . so , while i'm personally not ready to anoint el cid as the timeless epic classic that it has become , i'll not pepper it with arrows of disdain , either . this is a grand movie with tremendous aspirations that are not always realized . nevertheless , it's an entertaining , if not transcendental way to spend three-plus hours .",0.7
"by now , i've come to the conclusion that the filmmakers of every "" generation x "" movie feel that they must include heavy doses of angst and aimlessness . motion picture people seem to think so . there's nothing here that hasn't been presented before , often in a more original context . jake is a self-centered character , and it isn't necessarily great fun to spend ninety-one minutes with him . the early stages of their romance is conveyed with honesty and genuine humor , before jake's on-screen presence starts to become oppressive . like annie hall , however , this is more a picture about breaking up than coming together . the leads are both good . by sheer force of personality , eric stoltz enables us to occasionally sympathize with his character , and mary-louise parker brings a heart-wrenching blend of independence and vulnerability to joanne . in many ways , the history of naked in new york's development is almost as interesting as the film itself . the script attracted a great deal of attention in the business , resulting in a cast that is , to put it mildly , loaded . had this kind of wit and originality infused the bulk of naked in new york , it could have been a memorable motion picture . sadly , moments like that are scarce , and most of the charm of the movie results from its likeable lead actors .",0.63

"smilla's sense of snow ( say it three times fast and sound like an asp ) opens with a breathtaking image : great cliffs of gray-blue ice towering over a vast plain of white . and , while this sequence seems completely disconnected with the movie that follows , it is a visually pleasing way to introduce a contemporary mystery that incorporates murder , greed , and science fiction into an often uneven , occasionally preposterous , but always engrossing whole . although the action transpires entirely in copenhagen and greenland , the dialogue is exclusively in english , with nary a subtitle to be found . as thrillers go , smilla's sense of snow is definitely unconventional . the storyline is reasonably complex ( not to mention a little silly ) and features enough small surprises and twists to retain the average viewer's attention . and , the fact that it's a "" why-dunnit "" or "" how-dunnit , "" rather than a "" who-dunnit , "" allows us to focus on more interesting issues than identifying possible red herrings . as crisply directed by bille august ( pelle the conqueror ) , smilla's sense of snow moves rapidly -- almost too rapidly . the plot clicks along so briskly that numerous character details get lost in the rush . smilla , as forcefully portrayed by ormond , is a fascinating character , but many of the more interesting aspects of her personality are relegated to the background . in fact , there were times when i actually became annoyed at the film for pursuing the plot with single-minded determination rather than taking a few moments to delve more deeply into the main character . smilla is presented with enough detail to tantalize , but not enough to satisfy . in the end , we're left wishing the movie had spent a little more time filling in a few more blanks . aside from ormond , whose turn as smilla is both effective and attention-grabbing , and richard harris , who brings a world-weary cynicism to his part , the acting is surprisingly lackluster . he's supposed to be enigmatic , but the actor's one-note performance makes him lifeless . the film's climax will probably seem preposterous for anyone expecting smilla's sense of snow to stay grounded in reality . if nothing else , the opening sequence should prepare you to accept that boundaries not normally crossed in murder mysteries will be broken . smilla's sense of snow is not a landmark thriller , nor is it likely to appeal to those who demand a semblance of reality . but it is involving and entertaining , and features an intriguing , independent heroine . those things alone make it worth a trip to a nearby theater .",0.7

"a syrupy serving of freudian analysis that looks tempting but tastes of too much superego , id , and subconsious jive to be taken seriously . it's hollywood's version about what psychoanalysis is all about , which is making the analyst a combination of a savior and parental figure who can magically unlock the secrets of the mentally ill by offering them love and concern on a couch . this is the first major film about that subject , and its sincere presentation to show it in its best light is often awkward and seems quite outdated when viewed today . hitchcock throws in a murder mystery that works a little better than all the mumbo jumbo psych 1 lingo the viewer must sit through . it's a very heavy-handed film that is earnestly played by the stars , but has no resonance . it was one of the master's weaker films , yet it's still worth seeing because there are many imaginative hitchcock touches throughout . the script was written by ben hecht , who obviously didn't have much of a feel for the subject-matter . ingrid and peck do their best to work through the stale lines they are forced to say , though they never make their characters believable despite their best thespian efforts . this film is really spellbound .",0.5
"cast : massimo troisi , philippe noiret , maria grazia cucinotta , linda moretti director : michael radford producers : mario and vittoio cecchi gori , gaetano daniele screenplay : anna pavignano , michael radford , furio scarpelli , and massimo troisi based on the novel burning patience by antonio skarmeta cinematography : franco di giacomo u . s . distributor : miramax films in italian with subtitles the postman , an italian film from british director michael radford ( white mischief , the elixir ) , is a charming piece of cinema that takes several comfortable formulas and expands upon them in ingenious and emotionally-satisfying ways . there's a little of everything here : poetry , politics , humor , love , and heartbreak . best of all , these elements flow together seamlessly in a production characterized by solid acting , balanced pacing , and eye-catching cinematography . although all of the postman is wonderfully engaging , the last act lends added resonance to everything that has come before . the final thirty minutes change this film from a good little movie to a * great * little movie . radford has a subtle touch that draws out the best from characters and situations . one could argue that all films seek to manipulate ; in the case of the postman , it is done with the utmost skill . this picture is affecting because , instead of relying on hollywood's sledgehammer tactics of toying with an audience , it plumbs a wellspring of deeply-felt , honest emotion . in the final performance of a great career , massimo troisi ( who died at the age of 41 , shortly after completing this picture ) gives us a memorable character . hesitant , shy , and uncultured , mario has the heart of a poet , but little talent with words . in this post-forrest gump era , it would be easy to compare him to the tom hanks character , but mario is really a more complex individual . he occasionally makes some startlingly insightful observations , such as "" the whole world is a metaphor for something , "" often without realizing how thought-provoking his comments are . philipe noiret's pablo neruda is the perfect foil for mario -- a kindred spirit with all the experience and talent that the postman lacks . noiret plays neruda as part father-figure , part dreamer , and part realist . for two hours , it's possible to fall under the postman's spell and be completely enchanted . there is more vitality and genuine passion here than in any ten big-budget extravaganzas . this movie about words and images will delight not just because it entertains , but because it takes the motion picture experience one step further , and fulfills . look for the postman this summer . it will be one of the year's more rewarding theatrical experiences .",0.9

"warning : the review includes an important spoiler in the first and last paragraph . there's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits : this fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary , after it hits you over the head with the problems facing many american workers during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film looking like a real documentary . russ hexter , the 27-year-old writer-director , unexpectedly died of an aortic aneurysm shortly after shooting the innovative film , cutting short a possible brilliant career . the chasm between the locals and the newcomers is enormous , being caused mostly by a cultural clash . that it was not for real , does take away a lot of the film's impact and poignancy , but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut through something perplexing that is currently happening , that is part of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge . hexter has thrown open a look at all the social , political , and economic factors involved in the evolution of a small town , and he has done a nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most important thing to consider , even though in the bigger picture things might look like they are working out , there's still a face you have to put on someone who loses his job .",0.6
"coming-of-age movies generally fall into one of two categories : fresh , honest stories that transcend formulas or "" safe "" tales that embrace them . despite fitting perfectly into the latter camp , angus nevertheless works--at least to some degree . it is neither surprising nor original , but moments of genuine joy and poignancy , coupled with some solidly-developed characters , make angus a better film than the storyline suggests . unfortunately , a poor conclusion blunts many of the picture's better elements . that's because , regardless of his good-natured and self-deprecating personality , all his fellow schoolmates see is an overweight teen who sweats a lot and cares little for his appearance . it's a story that's played out everywhere in this world , both for children and adults--those who don't conform are ostracized , and the resulting pain can be a difficult burden to bear . however , while angus is fat , troy is short and skinny , with a face that resembles howdy doody's . angus is never subtle , but for the first seventy-five minutes , it gets the point across with style , humor , and an occasional bittersweet moment . the predictability isn't much of a drawback since the characters--particularly talbert's title personae--are essayed with great sympathy . and , while angus certainly isn't classic scott , the veteran's repartee with newcomer talbert is as well delivered as it is intelligently written . kathy bates is woefully underused in a role that gives her almost no screen time . all of us have been the butt of a joke at one point or another , so it's not hard to empathize with angus' situation . director patrick read johnson and his young actor effectively convey the awkward moments of being an out-of-place adolescent . unfortunately , angus is determined to have a grand , over-the-top ending that makes the finale of scent of a woman look restrained . how's that for cornball ? ? the watershed moment is too obvious , and no stone is left unturned in the attempt to get the audience up and clapping . however , as is often the case when a movie tries this hard , it destroys the illusion of the story and we become uncomfortably aware that we're watching something scripted and acted . on the whole , angus has its own kind of low-key magic , but the enchantment is rudely dispelled by the ill-advised final act .",0.61

"what the house of the spirits director bille august is trying to say with his version of the movie that has not been said so many times before remains unclear . although he assembles a strong cast to tell a powerful story , he has trouble breathing much life into it . most scenes are staged strictly by the book with only the brilliance of the source material and the extremely handsome production raising the picture above the ordinary . jorgen persson's cinematography dazzles the eyes with its lush colors . and the romantic music by basil poledouris has best seller written all over it . shine's academy award winner geoffrey rush , as inspector javert , proves to be the film's most troubling choice . unlike the highly emotive and agitated character in shine , rush makes the key role of the story's villain into a lifeless enigma with a single facial expression that looks like a head from mount rushmore . one wonders why the director didn't snap his fingers and ask rush to get with the program . thurman turns the character into a mawkish cliche . she is the only one to demonstrate strong emotions , both tragic and romantic . in the film's final battle sequence , complete with the killing of small children i should warn you , the movie gets the energy so absent from the body of the picture . a disappointing film that can be strangely cold and antiseptic , its wonderful story and its production save the day in the end . but if you don't want to see this version , you can rent one of the others or wait a few years for the next one . les miserables runs a bit long at 2 : 09 . it is rated pg-13 for violence and for some sexual content and would be fine for kids around twelve and up .",0.7

"robert deniro . dustin hoffman . kevin bacon . with a talented cast like this , it's virtually impossible to envision a bad movie , and , in that regard , sleepers doesn't surprise or disappoint . this is easily barry levinson's best effort of the decade , and it helps to erase the bad taste left by his early-'90s mega-flops toys and jimmy hollywood . despite protests from the catholic church ( which whines about any movie that portrays priests as anything less-than-pure ) , sleepers , which represents two and one-half hours of gripping entertainment , is well worth the price of admission . the movie is about revenge and redemption , and how , in america's darkest social corridors and backalleys , the two can be inextricably linked . yet , even though sleepers is basically a vigilante motion picture , it exists on a much higher plane than something like death wish , which offers a least common denominator , visceral satisfaction . there's little thrill in watching the vengeance extracted by the protagonists of this film because sleepers approaches its subject with a conscience . in fact , father bobby's dilemma is arguably the most compelling aspect of sleepers' second half . the film's sluggish final hour is its weakest portion , but there's still enough there to maintain audience interest . we've spent a long time with these characters , and we're not about to abandon them because levinson doesn't move things as smoothly to the climax as we might prefer . like most boys , they're curious about sex , enjoy playing stickball , and have an appetite for pranks . sleepers' provocative script is marred only by an unnecessarily verbose voiceover narrative and the protracted final third . one of the most fascinating aspects of the movie is watching how the law can be manipulated to deliver justice in a manner that was never intended . and , while michael's scheme may be a little too convoluted to be plausible , it's nevertheless entertaining to watch the pieces fall into place . at what point do the demands of basic humanity take precedence over the oaths and responsibilities of the cloth ? much of this struggle is not played out in words , but in bobby's face , and , with an actor of lesser ability than deniro , the emotional resonance of the internal war could have been lost . deniro isn't the only one to turn in a powerful performance . sleepers is as well-acted as it is deftly-crafted . there are those who may be disconcerted by the intensity of the reform school scenes ( nothing overly graphic is shown , but much is implied ) . levinson takes us through every phase of the boys' torture so that , when the time comes , we can understand and sympathize with their need to emulate the hero of their favorite book , the count of monte cristo , and exact decisive retribution . as sleepers opens in theaters , members of the media are trying to determine how much of this film is grounded in reality . ultimately , however , it doesn't make much difference whether the events of sleepers happened or not . the themes and messages are no less valid either way , and , even if it isn't a true story , events like these could have transpired . fact or fiction , this is a memorable motion picture . -- ingmar bergman",0.8

"wim wenders' the end of violence offers the same type of experience one could expect from sitting through a david lynch film with a reasonably-coherent narrative ( unlike , for example , lost highway ) . arguably wenders' most disjointed film to date , the end of violence is a neo-noir thriller that's really more about social decay and human isolation than it is about government conspiracies , mysterious murders , and missing persons . unfortunately , it's also too long and too slow , and , by the time the end credits have started rolling , it has lost most of its energy . wenders' narrative style is not only a little too languid , but it's often irritating in the erratic manner that it skips back and forth between divergent storylines . the problem is that wenders has three groups of characters to divide time between , and he often switches from one to another just when things are getting interesting . this is certainly not happening by accident . it's as if wenders wanted to make the transitions as jarring and frustrating as possible . ultimately , this results in a motion picture that , despite having intriguing aspects , is never fully satisfying . he's never without at least one lap-top and two cellular phones . for him , communication is a means of transferring necessary information -- nothing more . there is certainly no emotion involved . many of their scenes are obviously intended as homages to the great noir thrillers of the '40s and '50s , with both cat and "" doc "" dressed and acting the parts of the stars of that era . anyone expecting a straightforward thriller is in for a very big disappointment . wenders and screenwriter nicholas klein aren't interested in answering many of the questions posed by the narrative -- in fact , they only hint at possible solutions to several of the biggest issues . and the ending , such as it is , leaves a lot of room for interpretation . on the other hand , if you approach this film as a study of the mutability of human nature , the need for redemption , the growing lack of meaningful human interaction in the electronic era , and the lure of violence , it has the power to involve , if not overwhelm . ultimately , the noir thriller is just the means that wenders uses to explore these issues . if only he had managed to inject a little more life into the proceedings . . . the acting in the end of violence seems either strangely muted or outrageously over-the-top . aside from traci lind and loren dean , who are pleasantly enjoyable as they imitate past performances rather than create something original , there isn't a single portrayal in this film that attracted my attention . the film's title is richly ironic because this movie is about the proliferation of violence , not its end . wenders has packed a lot of issues into the end of violence , and i challenge anyone to call the script "" dumb . "" sadly , however , unlike the director's best work ( the wings of desire ) , it's neither involving nor magical . the end of violence offers viewers opportunities to ponder a variety of diverse subjects , but its overall entertainment value is less than one might hope for . great ideas and eye-catching cinematography only add up to a wonderful movie when they're contained in a powerful narrative . and that's the one key ingredient where the end of violence falls short .

"in 1991 , disney developed that idea into a movie called the rocketeer . a happy-go-lucky time , full of lavish nightclubs and barnstorming aviators . marilyn vance-straker's costumes for cliff are a delightful reinterpretation of those worn by buck rogers . the sets by james d . bissell capture a glamour that probably never existed except in our minds . james horner's music stays energetic and sugary sweet . one gets the sense that all of the cast and crew viewed the film as a romp . in good buck rogers fashion , which is the series the show most closely resembles , logic goes out the window . anyone wearing the rocket would have a barbecued rear and legs . the illogical aspects are not germane since the story stays totally in fantasyland . the problem with the film is that it is nothing more than an exercise in whimsical style . nothing in the narrative is compelling . in place of a story we have antics . cliff goes through all of the canonical gags including shooting out-of-control through a clothesline of freshly washed clothes . one gets tired of recycled comedy . still the scenes of soaring with the rocket are great fun , and they are fresh . well , fresh if you are too old to remember early science fiction movies . the biggest failing of the film is the casting of the lead . it is easy to see why bill campbell has never been given an important movie role before or since . campbell has no personality so his acting detracts from instead of enhancing cliff's persona . arkin , dalton , and connelly give nice performances , but all have done much better work . director joe johnson seems happy to let the actors in the film drift just so long as the atmosphere stays completely nostalgic . exercises in style like this are rarely enough for adults , although they can be enough to satisfy younger viewers . but not too young since tommy guns blast everywhere , and scores of people die in the film . nevertheless , the picture keeps its violence mainly at the cartoon level . and the acting too . it is rated pg although given the level of violence , pg-13 might have been more appropriate . the film should be fine for most kids say 7 or 8 and up , but be careful if they are sensitive to violence . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the movie was "" good .

"screenplay : robert king . all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . on screen , it's still paper thin .",0.4
"danish director lars von trier's highly acclaimed film breaking the waves explored its protagonist's conflict between her love and her god . norwegian director berit nesheim's the other side of sunday covers similar ground , but rather than a newlywed , its heroine is a young teenage girl facing the horrors of puberty . breaking the waves is close to the top of just about every critic's best of the year list for 1996 , and , although trier's picture is the better of the two films , i was similarly moved by both . american movies are obsessed with violent subject matter , and yet , luckily , violence rarely affects most of us personally . given all the life threatening situations movie characters encounter , you would expect to see them resort to prayer fairly often , but you do not . this film ignores violence and focuses its attention on faith and love . like the rebellious heroine in welcome to the dollhouse , maria is a young teen . if she had a single wish , it would probably be bigger breasts . arne borsheim's handsome cinematography is quietly in evidence , especially in the outdoor scenes . the music by bent aaserud and geir bohren for this gentle film is suitably lovely and moving , and many of the pieces have religious overtones . maria even gets into theological arguments with her father on jesus's need to go to the bathroom -- just like everyone else . let us pray and laugh . "" much of the film deals with maria's exploration of her budding sexuality . this is a rich film and has all of the truth of life . it is so easy to empathize with maria's frustrations and temptations . this deeply wounds her self-esteem .

"told with heavy narration , the film possesses a realistic nostalgia blended with the magic of youthful dreams and tribulations . the movie's director is david mickey evans , who wrote the script with robert gunter , and together they have created a show that has the essence of truth as if in a biography but with the liberties of a coming of age comedy . the game never ends , they don't keep score and there are no sides . they play for the pure exhilaration of the sport , which they all worship . the adults in the picture have quite brief , but important roles . ( perhaps the reason i like the story so much is that smalls's baseball ability or lack thereof reminds me so much of myself when i was his age . balls would fly past me , going under my legs or over my head but rarely into my glove .

"" basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film .",0.2
"screenplay : kevin wade and chris conrad . director : ivan reitman . in 1988 , arnold schwarzenegger , danny devito and ivan reitman set the standard for "" high concept "" with their comic vehicle twins . in hollywood pitch-meeting parlance , it could be reduced to five words-- "" schwarzenegger and devito are twins "" --and proved that sometimes a simple idea and the right talent could add up to $100 million even with a paper-thin script . and in a limited sense , it works . junior is so simple and gently directed that the warm performances of emma thompson and schwarzenegger manage to struggle through a script that always goes for the easy gag , and even then can't make most of them particularly funny . the impregnation is a success , but of course complications ensue . this is not hollywood's first attempt at a pregnant man story , and the disastrous first attempt ( the joan rivers-directed billy crystal vehicle rabbit test ) would not seem to inspire eagerness to give the premise another try . the joke in junior , of course , isn't just that a man is pregnant ; it's that the man in question is arnold schwarzenegger . schwarzenegger's choices of roles in the last several years have demonstrated a mastery of his own image , as he alternates action blockbusters with against-type comedies , and he has proved remarkably adept at both . as limited as his acting skills may be , he is usually very likable , and junior is no exception . those familiar with thompson only from her branagh/shakespeare and merchant/ivory efforts will be quite pleasantly surprised by her goofy performance in junior . her dianna , a clumsy and socially inept scientist , is the perfect match for schwarzenegger's hesse , and thompson's delightful moments of physical comedy make her scenes with arnold very appealing . that's really what junior has going for it : appealing performers at their most appealing . most of the jokes are based on the obvious incongruities of schwarzenegger in the family way--his appearance in a prosthetic belly ; his emotional response to a sappy kodak commercial ; his delivery of lines like , "" my nipples are very sensitive . "" and it's only because schwarzenegger seems to be having so much fun that any of it works . other bits , including the obligatory scene of a baby with urine streaming down its leg , are too trite for any amount of good will to make them work . the script , credited to kevin wade and chris conrad , is full of missed opportunities and silliness instead of any real inventiveness . frank langella , who was so good in the reitman-directed dave last year , is woefully underused as the obligatory villain , and gets the most obvious comeuppance available . perhaps that's the word that defines junior best : obvious . this is terrain we've all seen many , many times before . but the cast of junior is so engaging that it feels like we're seeing that terrain in a very comfortable car , in the company of old friends .",0.6
"so , is your adrenaline a little low ? since steven seagal is on the marquee , you figure , hey , this has got to be another steven seagal action film , right ? steven seagal has basically a cameo role and disappears early on , never to be seen again . moreover , you even guessed the wrong genre ; this is a thriller . although there is action , most of the movie's time and tension is spent in mental anguish with lots of sweaty brows as the time for disaster approaches . right then and there , the whole audience knows the ending of the show , but it doesn't matter because editor turned director stuart baird is so good at keeping the tension mounting . platt does all nerds proud and the classic little straw he sucks on turns out to be one of the heroes of the show . i will not cover what happens next , but suffice it to say that your heart may try to pound out of your chest as mine did . i even found my body shaking some on the defusing the bomb scenes . beside what i believe is one of the best performances ever by russell , many others are great too . halle barry plays a brave and resourceful airline stewardess . the only weak character in the show is an ambitious senator ( j . this character happens to be on board the plane , but i wish he hadn't been . you could be the one to negotiate with the terrorists . "" walsh's performance is extremely weak , and the movie would have been more focused without his character . the show works because of the tension , but there is one technical aspect deserving of special mention , the cinematography by alex thomson . the first time we witness the terrorists in action , they are shown in black and white slow motion sequences that slowly gain color before dissolving into the next black and white sequence . see the show at your local monster screen house because the images of the stealth fighter coming right at you in the hazy yellow and red glow of early morning are quite impressive as is the sound . the whole linkup sequence is another marvel to behold . finally , although the show does not try to overwhelm its viewers with technology , i was fascinated by the way the soldiers look through cameras with small flexible tubing to see what is going in the main cabin . the script by jim and john thomas sticks to the suspense to keep the show going . other writers would have gone for a lot more laughs . they do use humor , but sparingly . upon boarding the 747 , one of the soldiers says , "" i hope they have a good movie on this flight . "" executive decision , by the way , is one film i guarantee you , you will never see on an airplane . the movie ends with frank sinatra singing , "" it's nice to go traveling , but oh so much nicer to come home .

"where are the flying cows when you really need them ? dante's peak is obviously predicated on the dubious idea that bigger is better . 1996's twister brought in hundreds of millions at the box office by showcasing relatively small ( if something so destructive can be gauged as "" small "" ) natural disasters -- namely , tornadoes . the next logical step would be to go for something larger and more devastating . apparently , hurricanes weren't deemed visually impressive enough and earthquakes have been done to death , so hollywood has set its sights on volcanoes with not one , but two , similarly-themed disaster flicks . let's just hope volcano shows a glimmer more intelligence , not to mention a higher energy level , than dante's peak . no one is ever going to accuse twister of being a masterpiece of originality , but , as roller-coaster movie go , it's a great deal of fun . part of the reason is the effective use of audio and visual effects ; the other part is that director jan de bont knows how to get the adrenaline flowing . twister is a rush . dante's peak , on the other hand , is a bore . oh , it has its moments , but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes . the first hour , which is all typical disaster movie setup , is interminable . in keeping with time-tested formulas , we have a male/female pairing , children and animals in danger , a voice of reason that no one listens to until its too late , and a character with a tragedy in the past . the first hour of dante's peak is spent getting to know the characters . not that we need that much time , since they're all familiar types . if you manage to stay awake through fifty-five minutes of drivel , you'll be rewarded with some nifty special effects as the mountain throws everything it has at the town : fire , water , air , and earth . it's pretty impressive , i admit , but there's an unwelcome sense of deja vu . as recently as the aforementioned twister , we've already been there and done that , and it was a lot more enjoyable last time around . brosnan and hamilton gamely try to generate some chemistry , and , while both are appealing in their own right , the moronic plotline and dumb dialogue defeat them at nearly every turn . it will come as no surprise for astute viewers to learn that the screenwriter for dante's peak , leslie bohem , also wrote stallone's daylight . both movies feature some similarly embarrassing bad lines . meanwhile , director roger donaldson ( no way out , the getaway ) fails repeatedly to do anything interesting to enliven the proceedings . even discounting the first hour , dante's peak still isn't all that satisfying . i suppose there's a certain degree of tension as harry and company flee rivers of molten lava and volcanic shockwaves in their attempt to get out of town before it's buried in ash , but , with everything being done according to a well-established formula , the level of excitement stays low . once the film is over , you'll likely acknowledge that , although there's some nice eye candy , the experience as a whole leaves something to be desired . and there aren't even any flying cows to redeem the situation .",0.55
"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike .

"the gift is a supernatural thriller whose motto is : 'always follow your instincts . ' unfortunately because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic , i wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as i should have been . when you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does and that person is playing a psychic , then there is something amiss about the story . the suspense always felt tacked on to all the psychic visions that dramatically kept the pot boiling . this ploy always felt contrived and the film never quite felt real . ribisi's portrayal was hammy and particularly uninteresting . the trial was poorly filmed and made a mockery of how a trial should be run . this whodunit had many contrivances and they all sapped strength from the film's already rather weak mystery story . the two things that kept this film watchable were the suspenseful visuals of annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things from the dead world , and cate's gifted performance , that brought more to the story than the script by billy bob thornton and tom epperson could provide . as a hollywood film it fails to deliver enough punch to be a box-office hit , but as a b-film it seems easier to overlook the film's lack of punch to its story and accept its ordinary gothic story as possibly having more to it than presented .",0.4
"screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen is one of the unlikeliest film-makers i can think of to try to revive the movie musical . it is true that allen has made nostalgia something of his personal fiefdom , and that he clearly loves the old standards , but that doesn't necessarily make him the best man for the job . to oversimplify the matter somewhat , the near-total disappearance of the musical as a cinematic genre has been the product of a less innocent era ; for a musical to work its magic on you , you had to surrender to its often-absurd optimism , something increasingly difficult to do in a cynical time . woody allen may not necessarily be a cynic , but he has become somewhat synonymous with sophistication . everyone says i love you is an entertaining trifle which never truly transports you because allen is too often outside the genre . this may be the first meta-musical . everyone says i love you deals with the complicated romantic entanglements of an upscale extended family . everyone says i love you is an experiment , to be sure , with most of the actors singing their own parts and production numbers popping up in the oddest places . a couple of the numbers work superbly , notably a ghostly dance to "" enjoy yourself ( it's later than you think ) "" which is reminiscent of disneyland's haunted mansion , but watching this film makes you realize how long it may have been since you've seen characters break into song on screen ; even though you know it is a musical , it is a bit startling every time a song begins . the problem with everyone says i love you isn't the songs , it is allen's approach to them . his audience is notoriously upscale , and he makes his films decidedly with that audience in mind ; how better to explain the knowing laughter which accompanies a cameo appearance by itzhak perlman playing violin at a party ? in fact , knowing laughter plays a significant role in everyone says i love you . allen appears to be banking not on the songs and dances themselves being entertaining , but on their silly incongruity being entertaining . one moment , a light-hearted duet between goldie hawn and woody allen on the banks of the seine , strikes a perfect low-key tone , but it is a rare exception . allen has made a comedy in which the object of much of the humor is the fact that people are singing and dancing ; he is getting us to laugh _at_ the musical genre , not with it . one of the ironies of that effect is that allen may also have given a winking acknowledgment to critics of his romanticized view of new york . there is plenty to laugh at in everyone says i love you , from skylar's propensity for swallowing engagement rings to one hilarious swipe at italians from a teutonic housekeeper , as well as inspired performances by edward norton ( effortlessly charming in his two musical numbers ) and tim roth ( hilarious as a suspicious criminal thrust into high society ) . curiously , those two performances also emphasize why everyone says i love you isn't better . they offer a couple of rare moments of unrestrained glee in a story which feels constrained by its characters' social positions , even though allen is all too conscious of the world in which he has set his story . it is noteworthy that the marx brothers play a significant role in the film's climax ( as well as the title , a tune prominently featured in horse feathers ) , because everyone says i love you is a musical in the sense that the marx brothers' early films were musicals , where songs serving romantic sub-plots only got in the way of the real funny material . it is also set in the posh world the marxes used to tear to shreds , only the classy folks are the heroes this time . everyone says i love you sings , but it might have soared if the guiding sensibility had been groucho instead of margaret dumont .",0.7
"most of the time , it won't be anything flashy or exotic--just a normal tale of the minor ups and downs of day-to-day life . the last good time , the latest effort from actor-turned-director bob balaban ( my boyfriend's back ) , chronicles one of those simple-yet-affecting stories . approached with less sensitivity and intelligence , this movie could have been exploitative . however , there is nothing salacious about the last good time ; instead , it's an examination not so much of sexuality , but of friendship , need , and platonic love . the scenario is touching and tender , without a hint of artifice . there's no variety , but the unceasing blandness gives him a measure of comfort . there is a certain degree of sexual tension in their relationship , but it's neither provocative nor gratuitous . veteran actor mueller-stahl shows tremendous range in a role that demands the expression--and repression--of a variety of emotions . much of joseph's inner self is conveyed to the audience through body language and facial expressions . dialogue is used exclusively as a supplement ( in fact , it's over eight minutes into the movie before mueller-stahl speaks a word ) . olivia d'abo , while not given the opportunity to show the same breadth of character as her more experienced co-star , displays impressive depth . in what is by far her best screen performance to-date , d'abo uses charlotte's raw energy to ignite her scenes . this memorable performance is all the more surprising coming from an actress who hasn't previously shown such ability . these two actors provide the lion's share of the last good time's low-key humor . supporting the fine performances and well-crafted script is the evocative and atmospheric cinematography of claudia raschke . the dynamics of joseph and charlotte's interactions are , after all , the central focus of the last good time . the filmmakers' willingness to proceed with patience , allowing the drama to unfold naturally , affords the audience an opportunity to experience a marvelously complex , character-based study of two apparently-dissimilar people who recover lost fragments of their selves through each other . like before sunrise , the last good time has proven to be one of early 1995's most pleasant surprises .",0.84
"a spaghetti western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing , an outlandishly gross tale , dialogue that is meaningless , acting that's the pits , a body count for enemies that would satisfy the pentagon during the entire vietnam war , an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing flips , an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its neck , a drunk knife-thrower , one-dimensional villains , and an assortment of nonsensical gun duels . this film is so bad , so lacking in humor and romance , or any possible relation to reality , yet it is still mindlessly entertaining . there's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional hollywood looking plot but , nevertheless , typical italian action western . it's not for all tastes , even those who like westerns might not care for the amoral personification of the lee van cleef character . but you can't beat this film for continuous gunfights and mounting body counts . this is the first of a trilogy about sabata .",0.4

"taking a look at the above rating , you might be tempted to make a comment along the lines of , "" oh well , i guess the second beethoven isn't as good as the first . "" while that might seem a logical assumption ( given that a 3 . 9 isn't the kind of number on expects from a rousing success ) , it ignores one basic fact : i hated beethoven . i didn't just dislike the film , i loathed it--so much , in fact that it managed to make by bottom 10 of 1992 list . having made my feelings on the original perfectly clear , it's time to examine this worthy dog ( sorry , couldn't resist ) of a sequel . it is better than its predecessor , and demonstrably so . before i "" count the ways , "" however , here are a few words about the storyline . surprisingly , the bulk of this movie is not about how the dogs tear up the house . instead , the film is content to focus upon the rather insipid lives of the three newton children . now it's time to compare the sequel to the original , and understand why i didn't leave the theater shaking my head in disgust . to start with , beethoven's second made me laugh four or five times more than the first movie ( when i didn't chuckle once ) . some of the jokes are rather cruel ( along the lines of what happened to the crooks in home alone ) , but they're still amusing . an unintentional moment of mirth comes from seeing debi mazar's too-obvious stunt double take a fall for her . second , charles grodin and bonnie hunt have settled into roles that they seemed terribly embarrassed to be playing in beethoven . last time around , the dog may have outacted them , but they get their revenge this time , when they manage to give better performances than no fewer than six canines . third , there aren't nearly as many truly embarrassing moments featuring the newton kids . in fact , nicholle tom ( who plays ryce newton ) has a few scenes where she does something very much like acting . fourth , the story , as outlined above , isn't nearly as painful as its predecessor . granted , this one is dumb , but it doesn't reach the horribly inept levels to which beethoven sank . this is a case of general stupidity not quite being as pervasive . the audience at which beethoven is aimed is pretty much the same as for the original . children younger than ten years of age will enjoy themselves immensely , and adults who aren't much more discriminating than their offspring will also have a good time . however , those who expect legitimate entertainment are in for an unfortunate surprise--not that anyone should go into beethoven's second without a fair idea of what they're going to get . the basic premise is hardly a secret . on a more serious note , there is one area in which this film makes an unforgivable blunder . it attempts , in a rather offhand way , to address the issue of teen date rape ( no actual rape occurs , but it's clear where things are headed ) . this is turned into a big joke as beethoven literally brings down the house , but the introduction and handling of this serious societal problem is worse than a miscalculation--it's irresponsible and insensitive . if a movie intends to involve date rape , it should deal with the problem , not treat it like a passing and inconsequential incident . beethoven's second is one of those movies that doesn't require a review for the reader to determine whether or not he or she will be entertained . if you like charles grodin , bonnie hunt , saint bernards , and/or the first beethoven , you'll find something to enjoy about this movie , despite its numerous obvious faults . otherwise , don't bother . unless you have kids , that is . then you may not have a choice .",0.39

"" this is just the start of many cataclysmic rifts in the family . in contrast to the brash but honest fool , taro's wife , lady kaede ( mieko harada ) , is the most duplicitous and malevolent in a story which has no lack of villains . not a time of subtle leadership , the rulers , particularly the great lord , bark out their orders with such confidence and authority that they seem to be speaking to their entire kingdoms without aid of electronic amplification or transmission . extensive use of natural sounds and picturesque landscapes offers us a serenity that is soon shattered . heavy use of dramatic music made with flute and drums signals the story's shift from the merely argumentative family squabbles to the terror that each side will unleash to crush the other . magnificent blood reds and royal golds are used on toru takemitsu's oscar winning costumes . one of the most visually striking movies ever , ran had the bad luck to be released in the same year as out of africa , which beat it at oscar time for best set decoration , cinematography and direction . i loved out of africa , but each of these awards should have gone instead to another nominee that year , ran . visually and musically audacious , the movie's breathtaking images and sounds would suffice to tell the story . the dialog and incredible acting are icing on an already delicious cake . of course , one could make an argument that it is the look and music that enhances the acting . characters stand frozen at times and silence fills the theater as we contemplate the next actions . the tragedy , told with grand opera flourishes , is at once intimate and epic . the story flags a bit toward the end and a little judicious trimming would have improved it a bit , but that's a minor quibble .

"screenplay : amy schor & vicki polon . director : anthony minghella . sometimes , it's all about state of mind . either you're ready to enjoy a certain kind of movie , or you're not . i can envision a different set of circumstances under which i might have walked away from mr . wonderful with eyes rolling and a groan of "" puh-leez . "" but i didn't . instead , i found it to be a warm and charming lightweight romance , full of appealing performances and well-directed moments of tiny heartbreak . nothing about that premise screams originality . feuding exes who still carry a torch have been fodder for most daytime and nighttime soaps for ever . the relative success of mr . wonderful is attributable almost entirely to the cast . dillon is an extremely likable lug ; sciorra has the tense charm of a woman just discovering herself . their scenes together work to perfection because they manage to be thoroughly convincing as two people who have know each other , as lee notes , "" practically since i was born . "" they shift naturally between civil conversation and petty bickering , creating a genuine sense of history between them , and it's extremely entertaining to watch . it was the frequency of moments like that one which ultimately won me over to caring about these characters . parker has one of the most expressive mouths in films , and she uses it to show more different shades of emotion than she has lines . i also enjoyed david barry gray , who has an endearing puppy-dog energy about him as gus's best friend pope . this is not to say that all of the characters worked all the time . vincent d'onofrio only gets three scenes to develop what ends up being a rather important character , and consequently seems to try a bit too hard to make dominic angelic . and yes , dillon does have some overplayed moments , making gus's "" hidden emotions "" far too obvious for anyone with half a brain , or even a notochord . director anthony minghella , who gave us the low-key supernatural romance truly , madly , deeply , seems to have a knack for finding slices of real emotion without resorting to schmaltz . i was genuinely touched by a small moment involving a woman waiting for a blind date from a personals ad , as well as a brief conversation between rita and lee . however , these same moments also made me wonder whether mr . wonderful had missed an opportunity to be a more wide-ranging examination of everyone's search for a mr . or mr . wonderful , and what people are willing to do or give up for that chance . as it stands , the focus on the specific still held my attention . mr . wonderful is no work of art , but it's gentle and affirming and it caught me on a good day . kindly check in your cynicism at the door .",0.6

"a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind . it's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its dilemma in such a crisp way . what keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by macy who ably anchors the film , as he allows us to see who and what he is ; and , more importantly what suffering he is now going through . sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin . bain's complicity with sutherland adds to the psychological trauma of the macy character . in contrast to the men , neve campbell's performance is loud and reaching . as a character-driven film , it is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced screenwriter henry bromell . panic plays like an episode for homicide does that has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities . bromell , the homicide cop-show writer , has made a tv cop drama come to life as a b movie that can't get away from tv's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics . but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony .",0.6
"screenplay/director : david o . russell . spanking the monkey is as difficult to watch as any film this year . let me clarify that--that is not because it is terrible . on the contrary , spanking the monkey is one of the best films of 1994 to date . but it is not a pleasant experience . it's a blacker- than-pitch comedy about a particularly dysfunctional family , one in which we are witnesses to the implosion of the main character's psyche . what makes it impossible to look away is a pair of stunning lead performances in a story as horifically comic as anything concocted by david lynch . it's not an easy task . mrs . aibelli is demanding and depressive , and takes more than a passing interest in raymond's sex life . it is only because watson allows us to see mrs . aibelli's deep pain that actions which instinctively cause the audience to cringe also seem to make a kind of twisted sense . jeremy davies' performance as raymond is more restrained , but just as poignant . there is a lack of back story written in to russell's script , but davies fills in all the blanks with a reading that tells us that while what we see are extremes , this kind of dysfunction is nothing new to this family . davies carries himself in a state of perpetual tension , a tension which is denied simpler release at every opportunity , and finally boils over with results that prompt very nervous laughter . davies and watson deliver two of the best performances of the year , and give the unpleasant subject matter a surprising appeal . it does at times seem that russell has expended all his energy on the complexities of raymond and his mother . however there are so many piercingly insightful moments that these sketchy characters are easier to tolerate . one extremely effective scene shows raymond hanging out with some old high school acquaintances , guys he clearly didn't like then and likes even less now . it's a scene comic in its painful familiarity , and one more of the many things russell does right to highlight how trapped raymond feels . spanking the monkey deals with difficult subjects in a brutally honest manner , and will have an inherently limited audience , but it so daring and well-acted that it is worth risking the unpleasant taste it may leave in your mouth .",0.9

"there was a worm in the core of this turgid thriller that spoiled its taste . the moody production of smilla's sense of snow is adapted from peter hoeg's best-seller . this is a film with so much unrealized potential , about the icy heroine of the story , the tough-minded half-american and half-greenland inuit , smilla jaspersen ( julia ormond ) , who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a typical hollywood action heroine . smilla's sense of snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense local atmosphere , enigmatic characters and twists in the plot , to spin its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again . the danish director , bille august , who tries to be faithful to his fellow countryman's source material , presents a glossy and sleek looking film that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book , and comes up short in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story becomes . the film opens as a meteorite , in the greenland of 1859 , hits the ice and crushes everyone in the vicinity , including an inuit fisherman , putting on a spectacular light show in the crushed ice , reminding me of the pyrotechnics one would see at a july 4th celebration . what should strike the audience as even stranger is how the film ends up in the same ice caves where the film opened up its story in the 19th century . this is how one would do it in a formulaic hollywood film , thereby putting a damper on the terrific mood the film had just set . it was sort of like going to dinner and getting a whiff of some sensual aromas and looking at some appetizing food on display , but when getting down to the heart of the meal with great anticipation , suddenly discovering the meal is just not edible . if you can be satisfied with just the atmosphere and not the story or any character being developed adequately , then you might feel adequately nourished by what you saw . i wasn't . i was just swept away by the moody setting , the fine stoic performance by ormond , and the potential for intrigue -- which , unfortunately , never materialized as it could have .",0.4
"screenplay : jerome armstrong and billy ray . producers : neal h . moritz and andrew z . davis . director : mick jackson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it's hard to believe it has been over two and a half months since the last volcano movie hit north american screens ; it seems like only , gosh , seven or eight weeks . 20th century fox is banking on the fact that lava's lovelier the second time around , rolling out volcano as an april preview to the summer movie season , but whether or not it works depends on what you're looking for in your disaster movies . dante's peak was frequently dumb and predictable , but it also delivered suspense down the stretch in well-packaged bursts . volcano is less chained to convention , a bit more clever , and boasts a more talented cast . it is also more about spectacle than suspense , a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in . there are certain elements you have come to expect in a film of this kind , and volcano delivers all of them : intransigent bureaucrats who end up making a bad situation worse , a hero whose personal life is given equal footing with large-scale destruction , pets which make improbable escapes . fortunately , the script by jerome armstrong and billy ray offers a few variations on those themes along the way . the dialogue sometimes does get stilted and heavy-handed , and a few of the sub-plots -- including one involving a self-absorbed real estate developer ( john corbett ) -- are abandoned mid-stream without any fanfare . apparently someone realized that a fast pace and minimal exposition make for a better disaster . that doesn't prevent the writers from attempting some clumsy stabs at social commentary , which are notable largely because they are among the few attempts at making the film specific to l . a . as dopey as the tag line "" the coast is toast "" may be , it showed that the marketing people understood one of the more appealing elements of volcano's premise : people want to get a perverse charge out of watching tinseltown become tindertown . volcano could have used more of a sense of place , more recognizable landmarks like the angelyne billboard turned into briquets . sure , it's wonderful that racially-fragmented los angelenos become one big ashen can't-we-all-just-get-along family when forced to work together for the common weal , but be honest . wouldn't you rather see lava creeping up on a trademark l . a . traffic jam or chasing an army of suddenly less mellow in-line skaters through santa monica , instead of crawling like fluorescent tapioca down wilshire ? which is not to say that the fluorescent tapioca in question isn't extremely impressive . in fact , there are a lot of impressive visuals in volcano , including tactically launched lava bombs and a dizzying array of explosions . the pyrotechnicians earn every cent of their pay in volcano , but the imagery could have been accompanied by more tense set pieces . however , that's one of the rare moments when anyone seems to be in any genuine peril . i love l . a . , too , though i might have preferred it even more well-done .",0.6

"if someone was going to make a campy version of casablanca , you'd think they'd at least have the decency to make it fun . unfortunately , other than a couple of very obvious , absurdly over-the-top scenes , this film is just plain boring . aside from observing pamela anderson lee's apparent assets , the only reason to stay awake during barb wire is to see how often it pilfers from the bogart/bergman classic . the characters and setting may be based on the dark horse comic book , but the plot is pure cyberpunk casablanca . but there's a problem -- she and axel were once lovers , and she's never forgiven him for abandoning her in seattle . it's curious that no one thought to credit casablanca script writers julius j . epstein , philip g . epstein , and howard koch for at least "" inspiring "" the film . then again , for the sake of their reputations , maybe it's better this way . despite being outfitted in leather and spike heels , anderson lee doesn't make for an appealing action star -- the silicon enhancements might have screen presence , but the star doesn't . okay , so she looks good on a motorcycle , but that's about it . her delivery of the requisite quips is awful , and her signature line ( "" don't call me babe !

"starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez . screenplay : rose troche & guinevere turner . the problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with lesbians is that they have been just so * serious * . if you believed what you saw on the screen , you'd think that every lesbian relationship involved a "" fallen "" heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual identity . even at their best , such "" love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name "" melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality i have seen . what a breath of fresh air go fish is : a low-budget romantic comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day lives . though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally distracting , go fish is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure , playing like a sort of when sally met sally . . . . go fish was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for turner and co-scripter/director rose troche , so it may seem unfair to criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing . however , many of the rookie mistakes troche makes are difficult to pass off on economics . between scenes , she often inserts self-consciously artsy snippets of flashing lights , folded hands and spinning tops , and they just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film . it was as though troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a movie again , and thus threw every idea she had into this one , resulting in a somewhat scattered final product . troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast , and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy characters . the best role belongs to turner , an appealing presence with self-effacing humor . she delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit , and anchors the scenes in which she , evy , daria and daria's amour-du-jour comment on max and ely's relationship . not so fortunate is v . s . brodie , who stumbles her way through a part written more through other characters observations than through anything ely says or does . while i have no problem with the idea that max might see past ely's unconventional looks , i would expect there to be a more interesting personality for her to find there . as underdeveloped as some of the characters might be , they still have plenty of funny things to say . in the film's opening scene , kia leads a class in speculating on what historical figures , celebrities , and even fictional characters might have been lesbians . the "" talking heads "" scenes are particularly entertaining , chief among them a discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia . and in the film's sweetest and funniest moment , ely practically skips home after a particularly good evening with max . yet as amusing as go fish is , it is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian in the 1990's . go fish is not without its bumps and flaws , but it is both funny enough and insightful enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters .",0.6
"it seems that in the 18th and 19th centuries there were singers called castrati . the movie was quite explicit in demonstrating their techniques . the women of the 1700s appeared to be big fans of this sport . success gives him little pleasure . quite a contrast . as the movie evolves , the script by andree and gerard corbiau shows us that actually both brothers are troubled and tormented . although farinelli was nominated for an oscar for best foreign film , i found the quality of this movie to be all over the map . the good parts are brilliant , but poor ones will put you to sleep . the story is so unique and fascinating , and the technical aspects of the film so well done , that i could not think about missing seeing this show . sort of a must see , poorly executed picture . okay , what is good about it ? totally believable . second , the art decoration and the cinematography ( walther van den ende ) of the baroque opera houses of the period as well as the costumes were unsurpassed . the clothes that farinelli wore were so imaginative that i wished the costume designer and the set decorator had both won oscars for their work . the acting by enrico loverso is consistently excellent . on the poor side is the script and the directing . the movie starts off with plenty of energy , but after an hour , i was spending a lot of time looking at my watch . the show wore out its welcome . i wish i had left after the first hour . one final negative point , i found krabbe's performance to be pedestrian and unimaginative . although farinelli did not have the material to run the 1 : 50 that it did , i was fond of some of the editing ( joelle hache ) techniques where he would cut from very quiet scenes to loud noisy ones like the hoof beats of large running white horses . the movie is rated r for nudity , sex , drug use , and some realistically bloody scenes . it is basically pretty mild given its subject and would be fine for most teenagers . it is in italian and french with easy to follow english subtitles . for the brilliance of the good parts and for the not to be missed story , i recommend the movie and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 1 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.6
"in writer/director jeremy podeswa's mesmerizing the five senses , rona ( mary-louise parker from grand canyon ) has a small problem -- an impaired sense of taste . a baker who creates marvelous-looking but incredibly-bland cakes , rona hasn't a clue as to how to create flavor . this is one of many overlapping stories in the five senses . using this plot gimmick , podeswa , an extremely gifted writer and director , never lets the limitations of the setup confine the bounds of his storytelling . the beauty of the story is that no matter how much we learn about each character , we are compelled to discover even more . most writers introduce a dozen main characters only to the detriment of narrative clarity , but podeswa manages to create complex characterization within the bounds of minimal screen time . his movie calls to mind lawrence kasdan's grand canyon in the depth of its characterization . the five senses in tone most reminds one of another canadian film , the sweet hereafter , but the five senses mixes comedy and romance with its tragedies . the deliberate and successful slow pacing works in both pictures , whereas slowness is usually cinematic death for a film . robert is a funny , friendly guy , who is light-years away from the clich ? s we are normally presented with as gay people . his search has the same bittersweet tone as the rest of the movie , but his character works so hard to be happy that we could vote him "" most wanting to succeed .

"director : david lynch . mpaa rating : g ( mild profanity ) running time : 111 minutes . in most exceptional films , there is a moment early on when you can just tell you're tapped into something special . where we see alvin's puttering rig about 100 yards from where we last saw it . i think that shot might have been one of the best of the year even if its only purpose had been as a shaggy dog joke . but it's more than that ; it's a remarkably efficient tone-setter . instantly , you know this is going to be a rather unique travelogue . you can begin to appreciate the truly inspired combination of freddie francis's cinematography and angelo badalamenti's fiddle-and-guitar road music that makes the straight story so evocative in its heartland sincerity . and you understand that slow , methodical persistence is central to this story's success -- not just in alvin's journey , but in lynch's willingness to ask his audience for some patience as the film unfolds . if you're busy rubbing your eyes incredulously , wondering if we could possibly be talking about the same david lynch who made "" twin peaks , "" blue velvet and lost highway , let me assure you that we are . we're also talking about the same david lynch who made the elephant man , another fact-based story overflowing with compassion and humanity . there may be something about working from real life that keeps lynch anchored , and it's a style that suits him well . as provocative as his more surreal films have been , they can make it difficult to appreciate what a talented director he is between the cringes and the head-scratching . in the straight story , he is more in command of his simple visual storytelling than he has ever been , which is not necessarily saying that the straight story is his best film . it's simply obvious , with none of the grotesquerie characteristic of other lynch films , that he knows exactly what works for any given story . he also knows that the straight story is more than a bunch of pretty pictures of the american midwest . richard farnsworth's performance is so low-key and naturalistic that it may not seem there's a lot going on , but alvin straight is a superbly crafted character . senior citizens rarely get the kind of showcase the straight story provides , and farnsworth does beautiful things with alvin . farnsworth does a fine job of pulling all possible sanctimony out of those scenes , but the film is still stronger when it's quiet and observant , soaring on the skills of francis and badalamenti . there's also a sly sense of humor to the straight story , including lynch's ability to poke fun at himself . it's exactly the kind of scene where lynch might have dipped into the creatures beneath the green lawn , or found some other bit of suburban horror . in the striaght story , he just tells a straight story , finding poetry in the simple reliability of a lawnmower's slow , steady journey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.9
"those expecting this to be an unapologetically silly movie are right on the money . however , as idiotic as it is , my boyfriend's back is not without a few redeeming qualities . much like last year's buffy the vampire slayer , there are enough clever touches to the film to keep it from becoming tedious or unwatchable . i would never argue that my boyfriend's back is a good movie , nor would i recommend it to anyone , but it's not nearly as awful as the title would suggest , and there are at least a few worse pictures available at the moment . one of the primary problems with this film is that while it has a fun , lighthearted tone , it isn't nearly funny enough . far too many jokes fall flat , and those that do succeed are more likely to provoke an amused smirk than any genuine laughter . the premise is somewhat underused , at least as far as humor goes . my boyfriend's back is pretty good at self-parody , though . the nonchalant way that everyone treats johnny's return is clever and enjoyable to watch . nothing that happens seems to shock anyone ; they take it all in stride . there is an anti-racist , anti-prejudice message that doesn't work . i recognize that the people behind my boyfriend's back are trying to do something positive , but comparing the plight of the undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea ; it's insensitive . i can even see where some might find it downright offensive . it's surprising how good the cast is . they do their jobs in the right spirit , giving excellent , deadpan ( no pun intended ) performances that keep this film from going into cardiac arrest . how fine actors like mary beth hurt and edward herrmann can keep straight faces through these proceedings is difficult to conceive . one inventive touch found in the movie serves to emphasize the comic-book quality of the story . many of the scenes are started with cartoon panels that turn into live-action sequences . director bob balaban has fun blending fantasy , comedy , and parody together , and does a surprisingly smooth job of it . if only his script had more bite , this could have been a worthwhile film . as it is , my boyfriend's back is about as mindless as a movie can get . that's not always a bad thing to say about a film , but it certainly isn't an heartfelt endorsement . maybe when it comes on cable , it will be worth a look--that's about the right medium for something of this sort . my boyfriend's back has its moments , just not enough of them . this review is copyright 1993 by james berardinelli",0.46

"starring : harrison ford , willem dafoe , joaquim de almeida , henry czerny , donald moffatt , anne archer . screenplay : donald stewart , steven zaillian and john milius . director : phillip noyce . pyrotechnicians have had quite a showcase summer at the movies . it seems as though something has been blowing up around every corner--a freight jet in speed , the seven mile bridge in true lies , half of boston in blown away . there are also explosions in clear and present danger , the latest adaptation of tom clancy's best-selling novels , but don't let them fool you into thinking that's all there is to it . clear and present danger is the summer's sharpest thriller , less break-neck than speed but just as consistently tense , and is a quantum improvement over the disappointing patriot games . i wasn't terribly optimistic about clear and present danger after director phillip noyce's sluggish work on patriot games and the appalling sliver , but his work here positively crackles . the level of tension is nearly perfect in scenes that ordinarily would be hum-drum , like a walk through an airport where ryan is being shadowed by clark , but we're often unsure where clark is . there are a few moments where noyce goes overboard , like an inexplicable slow-motion shot of escobedo in a batting cage , and a sequence at a funeral that plays far too much like the baptism sequence from the godfather . these are minor quibbles , however , in a film that comes off as one of the best espionage thrillers in a decade . it might have been even better if harrison ford had managed to break out of his recent habit of playing every part in a slight daze . clear and present danger asks very little from its cast as a whole , though , so ford's lower-than-low-key ryan doesn't seriously detract from the proceedings . but let's be real here : no one expected james bond to be multi-faceted and tormented . clear and present danger is thoroughly plot-driven from minute one , and its oddball screenwriting team of john ( red dawn ) milius and steven ( schindler's list ) zaillian ( along with donald stewart ) do an impressive job with a challenging adaptation . if political moralizing isn't your cup of tea , be forewarned : clear and present danger has more than its share . it also has as much action as the bloated true lies , and nearly as many honest laughs .",0.8

"screenplay : sofia coppola , based on the novel by jeffrey eugenides . director : sofia coppola . all right , admit it : the credits "" written and directed by sofia coppola "" don't exactly set the heart racing in anticipation of artistic triumph . your defining image of sofia coppola probably involves her single-handedly making the godfather part iii painful to watch . or maybe you go back farther , to her script credit on the lifeless "" life with zoe "" segment of new york stories . if so , then consider this ( perhaps faint ) praise for the virgin suicides : sofia shows more visual flair in her directorial debut than papa francis has managed to show in the last 20 years or so . if only she had managed a bit more story sense . stylistically , coppola does plenty to keep the film interesting . there are few gimmicks she's unwilling to employ : slow-motion , split screens , odd angles . she also crafts one extremely effective sequence at a homecoming dance that captures every nuance of adolescent romantic fumbling . her approach shows coppola understands that the virgin suicides is not a simple narrative , but a flashback remembrance of pubescent fantasy . the girls are representations of idealized visions by the story's collective male narrator ( given voice by giovanni ribisi ) , not fully-realized characters -- and that's fine . sounds good on paper , doesn't it ? it's true that coppola gives the virgin suicides just the right atmosphere , but she never manages to latch onto anything that would give the story focus or momentum . her biggest mistake is making arbitrary use of the novel's structure as a remembrance told from a distance of many years , much of it through imperfectly recalled interviews with key players . it's a great scene -- effectively demonstrating the lasting effect the lisbon girls had on those around them -- but it also serves to show how much better the film would have been with more moments like it . the tale's young male observers also disappear for long stretches , allowing the film to drift into trite suburban family drama . on the page , the virgin suicides was hypnotic and mysterious ; on the screen , it's a collection of eye-catching individual moments that too rarely coalesce into something more profound . in a cinematic climate where films about adolescents usually bear little resemblance to reality , it's refreshing to find a film-maker interested in capturing the tangled emotions of that time . sofia coppola is working from a fundamentally strong source , and she has put together a cast and crew that make the virgin suicides worth watching ( and worth listening to , with its sublimely kitschy soundtrack of period tunes by elo , styx and heart ) . when it latches on to those moments of wonder at the emerging adulthood of the opposite sex -- one boy's wide-eyed discovery of feminine hygiene products in the lisbon bathroom , for instance -- it's dead on target . unfortunately , there's also too much of the mundane in coppola's adaptation . if she develops as much instinct for storytelling as she does for directing , sofia coppola could be a film-maker to watch for . and there's a prospect i'll bet you never expected . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.6
"the vision presented in larry clark's kids is as bleak as things get -- an ugly portrait of amoral youths who resort to drugs and sex not as a form of rebellion , but to fill the void of otherwise empty and meaningless lives . unfortunately , kids is an accurate portrayal of how certain inner city children live out their existences . take a look at the documentary teen dreams if you doubt how dangerously close to reality this fictional presentation comes . he looks "" normal "" -- perhaps even a little nerdy -- and can be polite and sincere when it suits him . but telly is an inveterate liar . not that he believes in aids anyway -- condoms , in his opinion , are a waste of time . nothing makes sense . kids is shot like a documentary and , in its uncompromising depiction of every aspect of the characters' social and sexual interactions , it seems almost too raw for fiction . clark has meticulously designed this movie to blur the lines between reality and scripted story , hiring 20 year old harmony korine to write a screenplay that reflects what's really going on in the streets . the actors are all newcomers , and their unfamiliar faces and unpolished-yet-effective performances add to the documentary-like effect . and what a twenty-four hours it is . . . kids will likely shock some viewers , but even those expecting this kind of grueling expose will be disturbed by the casual manner in which the most heinous acts are carried out . this is a tragedy without a last act -- a wrenching experience that offers no catharsis . one of the ironies surrounding kids is that the mpaa wanted to slap it with an nc-17 , which would have disallowed anyone under 17 from seeing it . yet , despite the graphic nature of the material , this is the sort of thing many teenagers live with every day -- so , apparently , the message is that they can experience it outside theaters , but not view it on the screen . miramax's decision to release the film unrated through a spinoff company at least allows the under-17 crowd an opportunity to see kids , if only in the company of a parent or legal guardian . those who call kids exploitative may have seen the film , but they haven't bothered to really watch it . there is not a gratuitous moment in this picture , although some of the images are so strong that viewers will wish to close their eyes or turn away .",0.87

"heard any good stories lately ? think any of them are true ? jon shear's edgy thriller , urbania , loves to mess with our minds , and it has lots of stories to tell us . set on a night with a built-in extra hour due to the daylight savings time shift , the episodic story has characters who relate incidents with varying degrees of believability . the reaction of the characters hearing the stories frequently reveals more about them than about the teller . sometimes nervous laughter will be followed by painful introspection . the disorienting film takes devious delight in layering various versions of the stories so that we feel like we're jurors looking into a courtroom lined with funhouse mirrors . what are we supposed to believe ? one thing certain in this intriguing and distorting tale is that our eyes are glued to the screen . the wonderfully labyrinthic script by daniel reitz and jon shear is based on reitz's play "" urban folk tales .

"there are those who will claim that sleepless in seattle is too corny , with sugar-coated cuteness filling in for the lack of a strong plot . and , while they have a point , there's something that the cynics are missing--it's meant to be that way . by its own admission , this film is intended to be a throwback to the screen romances of the past ( an affair to remember in particular , which is cited numerous times , and borrowed from explicitly and implicitly ) . anyone going to see sleepless in seattle expecting a tale of stark modern life has walked into the wrong theater . this is a timeless , dreamy fantasy whose mood falls somewhere between magic and reality . coincidence is the backbone of nora ephron's story , wending its way through the plot with uncanny repetitiveness . skillfully , however , the script turns to its advantage what could have been a major hindrance to the audience's suspension of disbelief . the concept of destiny is an important element to all that transpires . at the beginning of the film , annie is a realist who dismisses the idea of a supernatural sign as nothing more than a random occurrence . while this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie , especially amidst the burgeoning tide of action/adventure summer fare , it is not without flaws . the character of walter , although nicely played by bill pullman , is superfluous . his inclusion is meant to say something about annie's life and personality but , as the movie progresses , he becomes more of a hindrance and annoyance than an asset . his purpose is never clearly delineated and the too-neat resolution of this subplot is lacking in believability . the dinner scene with them near the beginning of the movie is pointless , with the attempts at humor coming across as weak and unfunny . little of value is revealed about any character . it's not that this part of the movie is unpleasant , but it doesn't seem to belong , and the cutting-room floor might have been a more appropriate place for it to reside . the ending is a little abrupt , but not in a bad sense . it's usually a positive trait of a film to keep the audience hungry at the conclusion . we want to see a little more--perhaps just a crumb to nibble on--even though it's clear that the story has reached its natural conclusion . more often than not , as is the case in sleepless , this is an indication that the characters have been well-defined and deftly portrayed . tom hanks , who is frequently chosen for parts that demand energy and verve , does an excellent job in a subdued role . it's easy enough to make the widower into a cliche , but mr . hanks' heartfelt performance , combined with an intelligent script , have avoided that . she's a likable actress who is fine for the part , but she has far fewer "" moments "" than mr . hanks . the supporting actors are effective . bill pullman , despite being saddled with a poorly-developed character , manages to make an impression ( sort of like in newsies ) . sleepless in seattle has been billed as a "" romantic comedy , "" but the accent is more on romance than humor . comic moments are kept to a minimum , and there are only a couple of openly funny scenes ( one involves a comparison of "" male "" and "" female "" movies--an affair to remember versus the dirty dozen ) . subtle humor abounds , but it's the kind that normal people encounter in everyday life , more often worthy of a chuckle than outright laughter . as an antidote to the summer doldrums and an alternative to dinosaurs , rock-climbing , and last action heroes , sleepless in seattle is perfect . while lacking the unfettered charm and exuberance of kenneth branagh's much ado about nothing , this film is enjoyable in its own right , not to mention more easily accessible . lovers will probably enjoy this a fraction better than singles , but there's more than enough in sleepless in seattle to cause the edges of just about everyone's lips to curl upwards . oh , one more gripe . brooks robinson , while unquestionably a great baseball player , is not ( as this film claims ) the lone choice for best third baseman of all time . of equal , if not greater , stature is a man by the name of mike schmidt .",0.7

"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . magoo being a prime example . the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . magoo can only be described as painfully bad . fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . mr . magoo provides only three such moments . the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . he said he liked home alone 3 much more . his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .",0.2

"there are plenty of strange , ironic and otherwise inexplicable things about hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s , but among the more puzzling is the way it treats "" star power . "" in the glory days of the studio system , hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at the time , always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe . plenty of films exist primarily to be glossy star packages , but the studios treat that fact as a dirty little secret . in these post-modern , indie-hip cinematic times of ours , it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see attractive people doing attractive things . that's the only explanation for the thomas crown affair , a star package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the glare . the thomas crown affair follows in the fine tradition of the original 1968 version , which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . the scenery , from the nightspots of the manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets , is lovingly photographed . director john mctiernan steps back from die hard-style pacing to establish a moderate , almost jazzy tempo for the too-cool characters and situations . brosnan , who probably emerged from the womb in a freshly pressed tuxedo , squints in a manly fashion ; russo , attempting to do for women's underwear what clark gable did for t-shirts , does the little black dress thing with slinky appeal . teflon should only be this slick . plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by this fantasia for beautiful people . i might even have been among them if the thomas crown affair hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant . it's an early signal that the film is going to play the "" sure , they're beautiful people , but they've got feelings too "" card . it's entertaining enough to watch as crown and banning circle each other , each one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee . russo plays the final half hour with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not to turn crown in made her hamlet to his polonius . i find myself in an awkward position as i criticize the thomas crown affair , because ultimately i fault it for trying to work in some subtext . plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext , mind you -- or the vaugest hint of a text , even -- but this film isn't one of them . it fairly screams out to be treated as a caper , with crown and banning spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote each other . there's just too much earnestness to the way they play it . by trying to play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism , the filmmakers miss the fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a movie that , ultimately , is about two movie stars together . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.5

"writer/director kevin smith's dogma is quite surprising , but not for the reasons you might expect . smith , famous for his hilarious brand of irreverent humor with films such as clerks and chasing amy , is back with his best motion picture ever , dogma , the most politically incorrect movie of the year . this is all as expected given its early positive buzz and its being dropped like a hot potato by its original distributor , disney . what is truly surprising is that dogma , while unabashedly ridiculing the catholic church , asks so many good questions and poses so many insights into the meaning of faith that it becomes the most religious movie of the year . usually when pictures want to make fun of organized religion , as the recent and awful stigmata did against the catholic church , they go for nothing but the cheap shots and never try to raise any genuine issues about belief in god . dogma , while firmly in the comedic camp , is as good a serious film as it is a funny one . only in its gratuitously violent scenes does the film go needlessly awry . he explains , among other things , that the film is a "" work of comedic fantasy "" and asks viewers not to "" pass undue judgment "" since that is "" reserved for god and god alone ( this goes for you film critics too ? just kidding ) .

"richard pearce's a family thing is a pleasant , if not especially groundbreaking , motion picture that takes the "" buddy movie "" concept a step forward by introducing themes of race relations and kinship . the film has more to say than might be initially obvious from the seemingly- straightforward script , which was written by one false move scribes billy bob thornton and tom epperson . all the topics presented on an intimate level are equally applicable to society as a whole , which has become more sensitive to issues of skin color than those of basic humanity . if you thought arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito made strange brothers , how about robert duvall and james earl jones ? as a family thing chronicles one man's gradual acceptance of himself , it reminds us that skin color is an artificial , not a natural , barrier . so what if earl's skin is lighter than ray's -- that doesn't change their shared parentage . the usual "" mismatched buddy "" film conventions are present : initial resentment and dislike that leads to a physical confrontation , followed by bonding and grudging admiration that grows into genuine affection . with actors of duvall and jones' caliber , however , such formulas attain a higher-than-ordinary level . despite its good intentions , a family thing could easily have been a mediocre drama , but the excellent performances elevate the film considerably . several scenes are over-the-top , and the character of ray's son , virgil ( michael beach ) , is woefully underdeveloped ( the result of editing choices ) , but , overall , this film is an agreeable exploration of what it means to be part of a family . much like the birdcage , although without that film's comic excesses , a family thing isn't just about accepting one's circumstances , but embracing them . the actors , playing characters it's easy to sympathize with , bring the story alive . because duvall and jones establish a successful rapport , a family thing has an unexpectedly strong emotional resonance , and that's a key reason why viewers are likely to leave this movie satisfied .",0.75

"sad to say , most wanted is yet another poorly-executed government conspiracy thriller , joining the lackluster ranks of shadow conspiracy , murder at 1600 , and conspiracy theory . most wanted is intended as a vehicle for keenan ivory wayans , action hero ( as opposed to keenan ivory wayans , talented comic ) . but , while wayans the actor has an undeniable screen presence , wayans the writer lets him down . not only is the screenplay for most wanted laughably absurd , but it contains line after line of the worst dialogue available in any film currently on a multiplex screen . yet the film makers still expect us to take most wanted seriously . in general , action films are not known for their intelligence , but this one takes assumptions of the audience's stupidity a little too far . for a movie this dimwitted to succeed , it has to keep viewers under a constant barrage of pyrotechnics , gunfire , chases , and other assorted thrills . it can't allow them a moment's pause to actually think . inexplicably , this is not first time director david glenn hogan's approach . so , although the action sequences are all well-choreographed , there are significant pauses between them . the film makers have foolishly inserted exposition into those dead zones , and the more we learn about the conspiracy underlying most wanted , the more we realize it would be better left unexplained . the movie opens with an offer . it's supposed to be a clean , quick operation , but it doesn't go that way . the conspiracy here has many levels , and the more diligently you try to figure out exactly what's going on , the more apparent it becomes how ludicrous the entire scheme is . most wanted features some adequate action sequences , but nothing that can suitably camouflage the weakness of the plot . wayans does the best he can with the role , but he only has himself to blame for its limitations . jon voight , who lately seems to be choosing roles that allow him to chew the scenery ( check out anaconda and u-turn for other examples ) , goes at it full-throttle here , recalling images of james woods and donald sutherland at their most over-the-top . jill hennessy ( a smile like yours ) is bland but attractive as dunn's hostage-turned-sidekick . and paul sorvino's quietly dignified performance is completely wasted . i'm getting bored of dumb action movies , and there have been far too many of them this year . when i go into a theater to see explosions and shootouts , i don't look for a script that resembles shakespeare , but i expect it to make sense and keep my attention . most wanted does neither . it's a poor excuse for entertainment , and , in the wake of the glimmer man , this has me seriously wondering about keenan ivory wayans' choice of motion picture material .

"producers : edward zwick , marshall herskovitz and laura bickford . director : steven soderbergh . in most films about drugs or drug addicts , drugs themselves are an almost supernatural presence . even the very good ones tend to turn addiction into a monster , something that stalks and consumes the people in the film -- a thc-laced blob , or a needle from the black lagoon . they may play with moral ambiguity , but ultimately they come down to a horror film mano a mano : either the monkey kills the hero , or the hero kills the monkey . in steven soderbergh's elusively gripping traffic , drugs are not a monster ; they're not even the villain . drugs become a character , crafted with more complexity and nuance than the human characters in most films . based on a bbc mini-series , traffic sets up an ambitious scope that proves absolutely critical to its effectiveness . every character in the film is in some way complicit in making the drug trade the violent beast it is , from the blatantly unconcerned mexican officials , to the wealthy white teenagers whose pretentious expressions of existential despair ignore the real-world implications of their drug use . steven gaghan's script never once offers either a pat condemnation of anti-drug efforts or a simplistic demonization of the substances themselves . it's a rich , deeply thought-provoking piece of work . it's not half-bad as pure film-making either . soderbergh has become a master of incorporating stylistic innovation into relatively mainstream fare , and he scores again here . the scenes set in mexico are given a grainy , saturated look that make the whole country look like it's suffering from a case of heat-stroke ; there's a sharp , sudden contrast with an early courtroom scene shot in an icy blue . traffic often has an almost improvisational edge to it , and virtually every scene and performance feels kinetic and urgent . this is a film full of scenes that grab you without a hint of melodrama , full of background characters ( peter riegert as ayala's smug attorney , "" that '70s show's "" topher grace as caroline's cocky boyfriend ) that burst to vibrant life . and that's saying nothing of at least one foreground character ( benicio del toro's conflicted cop ) so splendidly performed that his scenes seem like part of a documentary . traffic only hits speed bumps when the sheer density of the narrative becomes a hindrance . the script occasionally resorts to making speeches to make its points -- with ferrer's mid-level dealer in particular uttering "" you can't stop us "" taunts to law enforcement -- as though afraid the points already made by the arc of the story would be lost in the shuffle . some of the key characters feel vaguely under-developed , and there are a couple of late scenes and plot developments that feel forced into an already dense tale , giving traffic the sense of being over-loaded during its third act . it's still an awfully good third act , one that wraps up an even better movie with the perfect combination of harsh reality and genuinely satisfying optimism . i'm not sure you could say traffic ever takes a side on its difficult subject , unless it's the side that small , personal victories can still make a losing battle worth fighting . that's a refreshingly mature take on a subject that usually comes down to killing monsters . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .",0.9

""" it's not showgirls "" one trailer for striptease bluntly announces , capping off a marketing campaign which may be the first in recent memory to attempt to convince the movie-going public that a new film is _nothing_ like a previous film . sure , it works the other way all the time , thanks to pre-fabricated critical blurbs like "" this year's forrest gump "" or reminders of the director's previous successes , but the stink of showgirls is such that it threatens to contaminate anything featuring a pelvis and a pole . of course , if you remembered that writer-director andrew bergman is behind such comedic gems as the in-laws , the freshman and honeymoon in vegas , you'd know not to expect showgirls . the real question is whether you'd expect striptease , a film as inconsistent in its tone as it is occasionally hilarious . moore received the surprising sum of $12 . 5 million to bump-and-grind her way through striptease , and at the very least the producers should take solace in the fact that she picked up dancing a heck of a lot faster than she has picked up this whole acting thing . there is something both smug and overly earnest about moore's standard screen pose , as though she never wanted there to be any doubt that she felt deeply about whatever her predicament might be , but also that nothing could stop her if she set her mind to it . in striptease , that is a major problem . this is supposed to be a frisky comedy , but moore's deadly serious performance acts like ankle weights on a swimmer . there are scenes between her and armand assante which seem to come from a second-rate tv-movie -- "" baring her soul : the erin grant story . "" that's a real shame , because there are plenty of moments in striptease where bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine through . burt reynolds is completely over the top as dilbeck , a pathetic , fetishistic drunkard who coats himself in vaseline and sniffs erin's dryer lint before addressing a young christians' conference , and there is something improbably enjoyable about the way reynolds doesn't even pretend to modulate his performance . bergman makes fine use of oddball supporting characters , and seasons striptease liberally with his trademark unpredictability , like a priceless scene during the film's climax involving erin's daughter , two well-endowed dancers and a jump-rope . there are plenty of laughs in striptease , enough to make it moderately entertaining , but the reason striptease isn't a better movie is that they're the wrong _kind_ of laughs for the material . based on carl hiaasen's novel , the story demands a darker edge in its political satire , a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in the film with any morals . that simply isn't andrew bergman's style ; his comedy may be wild , but it's always good-natured . when burt reynolds' congressman is as absurd a character as the general played by richard libertini in the in-laws , it's tough to extract any biting commentary . the result is a film which is moving in several different directions at once : the source material is trying to make it dark , bergman is trying to make it silly , and moore is trying to make it serious . when it's silly , striptease is super , but a lot of the time it's not clear _what_ striptease is . except , of course , that it's _not_ showgirls .",0.6

"some day , hopefully , christina ricci will get a worthy showcase for her talents . it's not overstating the case to say that ricci is the best thing about these films . in fact , it's not far from the truth to say that she's the only worthwhile thing , especially where gold diggers is concerned . formulaic to a fault and guilty of trivializing a serious issue , gold diggers starts out messy and contrived , and never gets any better . the movie attempts to wed teen bonding with low-key adventure , while simultaneously tackling the issue of domestic violence . admittedly , i don't expect a once were warriors-type approach to wife-beating and child abuse in a pg-rated film , but a harder-hitting , less superficial style is requisite for a topic of this import . if you're going to do a movie about the subject , don't shortchange it the way gold diggers does . as teenager beth easton , ricci is marooned in a dumb story with a bunch of performers who don't pull equal weight . chlumsky was appealing in her previous outings , but here , with a short haircut and tomboyish attitude , she's less-than-endearing . polly draper , as beth's recently-widowed mother , is more irritating than sympathetic . although the two don't hit it off immediately , it doesn't take long for a friendship to develop . gold diggers is intended as a "" family film "" , but this is the kind of movie that gives family outings a bad name . the only ones likely to derive any enjoyment from this drivel are pre-teen girls . with its deus ex machina ending and juvenile prattle , this is not a picture designed for adult entertainment . far from striking gold , this film consistently comes up empty .",0.43
"in quite a contrast , the construction of this movie is symptomatic of much of the current degradation of our society . in the remake , producers brian grazer and russell simmon manage to transform a simple kids' comedy into the filthiest kids' movie i can ever remember seeing . certainly the show does have many funny parts , and eddie murphy does demonstrates tremendous acting bandwidth , nevertheless , as a picture marketed to youngsters and where the audience is filled with kids under ten , this film exemplifies all that is wrong in hollywood today . don't misread me . i am a libertarian when it comes to films . if produces want movies overflowing with bad language , that is a judgment call they get to make . however , in shows where the trailers make it look like good humored fun for kids , where the original movie was silly and innocent , where you know that a large portion of the audience will be kids under 10 and where the rating is pg-13 , one should not expect a constant stream of filthy language including crude sexual jokes about mothers . a few years ago , this movie would certainly have gotten an r , which would , of course , have decreased the box office take . to me this movie speaks volumes about the state of the country . adults should have their shows , but why do we think children should be taught the b and the n words ? the movie does have some good aspects and several big laughs , although not near enough for an adult audience . the film starts off quite promisingly . the plot by writers barry blaustein , steve oedekerk , tom shadyac , and david sheffield starts off to be a comedy with some serious messages . the messages surround how hard it is to get thin and how fat people are stigmatized and humiliated by society . the first message is trivialized , and the second is contradicted . the movie turns into a diatribe against fat people regardless of the movie's tacked on and moralistic ending . in an impressive acting demonstration by murphy we have him playing all of the roles of a large family with obese members . other scenes in the movie , thank goodness , do work better . jekyll and mr . murphy , who was so touching in coming to america , does his crude nightclub routine though most of the show . that he can play seven roles is an amazing testament to his inherent talents and to some great special make-up effects by rick baker , but why couldn't the sweet murphy come out when the picture calls for it ? why ? it is an r picture , but with an mpaa rating of pg-13 . do not take kids under 13 to see the show , and i would prefer to see teenagers be mature before going . in the end he gave the film a thumbs sideways . we try to investigate pg-13 films , but were lolled by the innocent trailers and the name of the picture to think this one would be okay . i do not recommend this lame picture to any age group , and i give it * 1/2 for a few nice laughs and excellent special effects . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .",0.4

"two things could be said for sure about this movie , which uses mostly nonprofessional actors , that it is disturbingly romantic and it is troublingly inconclusive . there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal . metaphors abound in this film , so much so that one could overdose on all the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about , which becomes the film's major fault . if you want something that is predictable about this unpredictable film , you have it here , you can bet your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will get it . if you want to read some politics into this film , you might say that the director was using the local american navy base as a metaphor , showing the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals , as he tried to get at what the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other . the mystery about them , gives them a camus-like sense of existentialism , it is as if the more modern the story tries to be , the more it can be seen rooted in an old philosophy , a philosophy of fatalism . the beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork , picking up one beautiful scene after another , though what connection this all has to do with the movie is anyone's guess . as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in . the trouble with that pat explanation of the film , is that the film doesn't help itself any by overloading the imagery , so that if one wanted to , there could by many other explanations for what the film was about . after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say . this is possible because of there persistent silence and lack of character development . aside from being a stunning film to watch , i could see no beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth . the film had too many missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful ; i could hardly remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film , only remembering how alluring vahina giocante was and how beautiful the south of france looks .",0.5
"starring : max von sydow , ed harris , bonnie bedelia , j . t . walsh . director : fraser c . heston . if one adds sequels , original screenplays and television adaptations , that totals roughly 50 hours of film treatment , about two thirds of which has been useful only as a mild sedative . although to state that king's works have fared poorly in translation to the screen may be to give him more credit than he is due , it is certainly true that king on screen has been far less successful than king in print . that is not likely to change with needful things . lacking the suspense to be a crossover hit like misery , or sufficient mayhem to please the freddy krueger crowd , it treads a soggy middle ground , going for cheap laughs rather than working up solid scares . there is the germ of an intriguing idea in needful things , one borrowed from ray bradbury's something wicked this way comes : what would you be willing to do for your heart's desire ? add to that the simmering hatreds and intolerance beneath the veneer of polite interaction , and there's the potential for something beyond your run-of-the-mill gore fest . screenwriter w . d . richter and director fraser c . heston set up reasonably well , but don't deliver . needful things seems to take forever to get any kind of momentum going , and when it does at last seem to be moving it runs into a brick wall of silly dialogue and shoddy acting . the latter is somewhat surprising given the reasonably talented cast . valri bromfield sneers and swears as a loony turkey farmer ; amanda plummer does a new england accented variation on her standard eccentric ; j . t . walsh seems to be channeling jack nicholson's performance from the shining , but without the charisma , as the town's pompous leading citizen . the biggest shock is von sydow , who seems completely miscast . he appears to revel in the campier elements , never bringing any genuine menace to gaunt . i suppose the blame for that lies with richter , best know as the creator of the campy cult favorite the adventures of buckaroo banzai . he seems to have been a poor choice for this job , sacrificing suspense for silly punch lines . his black-humored approach to the story just didn't work . similarly , director heston ( yes , _that_ heston's son ) doesn't quite have the deft touch required to direct suspense . he does a nice job with the fantasy sequences as gaunt entices his customers , but other elements go completely astray . he never gives his actors a sense for the proper tone , which makes it appear that harris and bedelia are acting in a different movie than everyone else . and he lays on the atmospheric smoke in gaunt's shop so thick i thought i could see it puffing in from off-camera . needful things is muddled , and in too many of the wrong hands . i did find a few moments of amusement , all of which were probably unintentional . in one scene , a jukebox skips while playing "" achy breaky heart , "" repeating the title over and over . also ironic is harris' statement that "" this is a quiet town .

"this indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches , as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way victor sees things . this is the kind of human interest story that hollywood slicks up and can't make in quite the same realistic way that a good indie film can be made , that takes its time in bringing out a number of small truths , so that by the time the story winds down , a big climactic ending is not needed , all the pain and pathos has already been drawn out of it . in contrast to victor's gentle nature , he's always high-strung . the film works so well because the performers are outstanding and the writer/director has come through with a very touching debut effort . there is something precious about this film , whether in shelley winters warm performance as a giving but possessive mother , or from pruitt taylor vince's priceless performance of someone who hardly speaks and is a doting son , longing for love and friendship , but who still hasn't matured , or from liv tyler's refreshing role as the one who breeds life into the dead feelings of both mother and son , giving them some hope for the future . the musical score arranged by thurston moore helped set the quiet mood needed for the story to gently unfold . everything about this original film was honest and natural . all the characters know what loneliness is , even if they mask it better than the mama's boy does , and because of that , it is easy to relate to their very demanding problems of loneliness and how it has eaten away at them -- making some fat , others blind to what they are , or bitter .",0.8

"even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place , the characters were seen dancing and horsing around , as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner . in reality , this never occurred in vietnam ; but , it is used by cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is . this one-shot theory when it is used for deer hunting , can be seen as something sensible , as if it reflects true sportsmanship . this film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and on those who were directly affected by it , as cimino makes no apology for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war , he only revels in how poignant michael's odyssey is-for he is the hero of this story and the most compelling one in it-but even he can't feel at home after his adventure , his war experiences were too mind-boggling for him to even talk about what is bothering him . what makes this film exceptional , one of the best films of the '70s , is not the story , which is good but not great , and not the cinematography , which is pleasing in scope but doesn't break new ground in its camera work . it is the performers themselves who take the story to spell-binding heights and make this a great film , making you care enormously about the characters they play . de niro gives a riveting performance as he searches for meaning to his life , making his patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no sense to a lot of people , something that needs no apology , just like his deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it ; that is , if you must kill a deer , at least , do it the right way . streep's performance is more subtle , as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under , not sure of what is happening to her , but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life . john savage is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and couldn't fully recover from it . walken won an oscar as a supporting actor , in a film that won a total of five oscars , including those for best picture , editing , sound , and director . the remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a tale of significant moral and political weight . cazale's performance as a weasel , staying out of the war , hiding behind a phony macho persona , is a fitting one , in contrast to the guys who enlisted . it is an astonishing film . a one of a kind experience . the stupidity of the war and all its atrocities , as it is stunningly presented by the filmmaker , leaves one without a chance to escape the moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture a lost innocence . the filmmaker seems to be saying , you can run away from vietnam and try to avoid it , but you can't get completely away from it , its devastation touched every part of america , and this film , whose viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum , as anti-war films usually are , but wants to respect the opinions of conservative working -class america , the one's who sent their sons to fight this war . and what the film offers as a poignant reminder about war , even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war , is how the war harmed even those who coolly survived it , and how it left the american psyche scarred for life .",0.9
"hollywood has a habit of producing multiple films about the same topic in a short span of time . so seven years in tibet , jean-jacques annaud's adaptation of heinrich harrer's 1953 autobiographical work , isn't the only 1997 film to cash in on the new wave of buddhism . both films have significant historical and thematic overlaps . those expecting a heavy dose of buddhist mysticism may be disappointed by seven years in tibet , which keeps its religious elements low-key . this is essentially the story of harrer's redemption , and , until the film's final quarter , annaud keeps the proceedings centered on him . in fact , it's during seven years' last act , which depicts china's ruthless submission of tibet during the 1950s , that the film's focus wavers . this attempt to broaden the movie's scope detracts from its primary story . the extra scenes serve only to divert our attention from harrer and prolong a movie that would have been more enjoyable with some additional pruning . of course , the end points of a spiritual journey matter less than the actual trek . so , although harrer starts out the movie as a cliche , his character is permitted enough growth to allow him to become progressively more human as the story advances . the latter scenes are especially effective , due in large part to a remarkable performance by jamyang wangchuk , whose fine acting makes it possible to believe that this boy , with all the natural curiosity of someone his age , has access to the wisdom of ages . next to wangchuk , pitt comes across as rather pedestrian -- his portrayal isn't exactly uninspired , but it's nothing special , and his inconsistent accent is a source of irritation . of the other actors , only lhakpa tsamchoe manages to forge an impression . david thewlis , who has been on a downhill slide since naked , is even more unremarkable than pitt . nevertheless , although he may not have the strongest leads , annaud compensates for the deficiency with stunning photography . cinematographer robert fraisse has used the glorious mountainscapes to their best effect , almost always affording the viewer with the opportunity to see something spectacular , such as a scene where two climbers are ascending a mountainside while silhouetted against a glorious sunset . it's a little ironic that , because of asian politics , annaud couldn't do any filming in the himalayas , and was forced to use the south american andes as stand-ins . ultimately , however , annaud's desire to create an epic tale actually harms the production , since it results in unnecessary scenes that pad the running length to more than two hours . the best moments in seven years are the quiet , intimate ones , and while there's some enjoyment to be gained from the more adventurous sequences , they pale in comparison to the interaction between harrer and the dalai lama . those are the times when seven years is at its best ; i just wish there had been a few more of them .

"a * * * * movie classic from 1987 , it was released theatrically by disney but was basically ignored . featuring a cast of mainly unknown voices in a low-budget production , it is worth renting again and again . sadly , the same cannot be said of its recent direct-to-video sequel , the brave little toaster goes to mars . one viewing is more than sufficient . one hopes the second , and purportedly the last , sequel will prove more imaginative . the series's appliances are among the most lovable animated characters in modern motion pictures . there are also a whole host of unnecessary new characters to clutter up what should be a simple story and cast . carroll , whose most recent movie , playing by heart , suffered from stiff dialog with excessive cleverness , comes up with a script this time that is almost terminally bland . the basic setup for the plot holds little promise , and carroll finds little interesting to do with it . or as our hero , the toaster , puts it better , "" the little master has been spacenapped ! "" the original movie had a cornucopia of sweetly hilarious lines that were full of poignancy and pathos . the deeply empathetic , little appliances were absolutely lovable . they still are , but this time they are being held hostage in a lackluster movie that isn't worthy of them . in order to pad the time to get the movie past the minimum time necessary to be considered a full-length feature , they inject a half-dozen , imminently forgettable songs . a helium , hippie balloon that's been floating in space since woodstock , sings one especially dull one . once the appliances get to mars , any hope for them to encounter some well-drawn villains , who could add some much-needed tension to the movie , vanishes . they shout , but they are far from threatening . the only truly funny part of the movie comes in the casting of a cameo . for the part of the faucet , they chose -- who else ? -- farrah fawcett . it is not rated but would certainly be a g , as it is appropriate for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 9 , kind of liked the movie , especially the character of blanky , and gave it * * . he complained that the sequel was a little stupid and the songs were not memorable . a big fan of the original , he thought this one wasn't near as good .",0.5

"in the most anticipated movie of the holiday season , jim carrey recreates boris karloff's famous grinch role in how the grinch stole christmas . the 1966 television original , an annual christmas tradition in the rhodes household , is an animated film . even if the remake pales in comparison to the original , it is a cute and funny movie in its own right . as you probably know , the grinch is a "" bah humbug "" kind of guy who tries to keep christmas from coming to the sweet whos by stealing all of their presents and decorations . in a tribute to the original show and book , the remake keeps most of the lines but adds in more story in order to triple the length of the original half-hour show . anthony hopkins , as the narrator , is the perfect choice to replace boris karloff , whose voice was the best part of the original production . with the exception of his speeding up and slurring a few lines , hopkins provides a wonderful rendition of the seuss rhyme . the inventive result is a snow-covered cross between willy wonka & the chocolate factory and the wizard of oz . only carrey's expressive mouth is recognizable . the story's laughs come from both the gadgets and the dialog . one of the funniest scenes occurs when the toddler grinch is offered christmas cookies on a plate made in the image of santa claus . biting off santa's head rather than eating a cookie , the little grinch announces , "" santa , bye-bye .

"no heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt at a trainspotting , performance , the long good friday , and a tarantino-like gangster/comedy , all rolled into one film , served up with an eastender's sense of vile english humor , as this is writer/director guy ritchie's first feature film , formerly known for his video commercials . he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile . this is just a bad film . a laurel and hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort . every character in the film tries to be a character , succeeding only in being a one-dimensional one , while women do not play a significant part in this unoriginal film , as they are reduced to being go-go girls or unnoticeable druggies . ritchie's aim for the film , is to keep the audience guessing at what is happening . the film gets carried away with trying to be too clever , as one character is always trying to top the other in craziness . the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers . since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure . if you take my advise , you'd avoid this one . i think you would get more satisfaction , if you are hooked on this type of film , in seeing something like reservoir dogs , even if you must see it again , it is better than seeing this poor imitation once .",0.2
"although one cannot be sure what angels look like , nicolas cage , dressed from head to toe in somber shades of black , makes a most impressive one . and unlike john travolta's jocular version , cage's has all the seriousness of an undertaker . with a tremendous sense of the visual but without much storytelling ability , director brad silberling attempts a remake of wim wenders's german film wings of desire . although wenders's film is only ten years , it is already being referred to as a classic . why silberling , whose only other film was the mediocre casper , thought this was the right time and he was the right person to redo so recent a movie remains unclear . with his long black coat and constant five-o'clock shadow , cage , using small variations on his basic melancholic expression , rethinks the whole concept of the angelic . they can be seen by mortals only if they want to be , which they rarely do . the picture is at its most magical during the eventual first touch and first kiss sequences . think way back to the excitement and rapture of the first time that you ever held a lover's hand and of your first romantic kiss . rising above even these experiences , the scenes exist on a higher plane that may make goose pimples crawl up and down your arms . the film works best when it reduces the story to a tableau . the tall , darkly dressed angles , dotting the beach for their morning music by gabriel yared , provide the impact that the script by dana stevens rarely delivers . ( wim wenders is also listed on the writing credits since he did the screenplay for the original movie . ) the audience at our screening was squirming in their seats since the movie seemed as though it was going on for an eternity . as good as some of the visuals are , they are highly repetitive and done excruciatingly slowly .

"she has succeeded , albeit perhaps * too * well . all the elements of this story are achingly familiar , having formed the plot core of everything from tv soap operas to harlequin romances . the only difference here is that all three participants are women -- but just because something is "" gay "" doesn't make it inherently better or more interesting than its "" straight "" counterpart . a tired story is worn out regardless of the sexual orientation of the characters . the first half-hour of devotion , while lively and energetic , has a glib tone that displays little sympathy for its characters . everyone is constantly smiling , but the happiness seems forced and unnatural . there's a jaded feel which threatens to alienate the audience . eventually , devotion softens its approach , devolving into a fairly routine melodramatic style with all the expected love triangle elements : passion , love , jealousy , and self-doubt . as the film moves along , it becomes possible to feel for the characters , even though the screenplay holds few epiphanies . devotion is graced by the strong performances of jan derbyshire and kate twa . it's a credit to the actresses that they're able to do something with such limited material . both throw themselves into the work with an earnestness that gets translated to the audience . on those rare occasions when devotion sparkles , it has little to do with the script and everything to do with its stars . regurgitated story and tone variations aside , one of the primary reasons why devotion represents such a dubious entertainment value is that it's far too long . there's not enough real psychological or emotional drama to sustain this story for two hours , and the average viewer will find herself or himself fidgeting through the last quarter . bits of devotion will strike a responsive chord with some audience members , but the movie as a whole doesn't reach the level of achievement it's striving for . ultimately , the strengths of the presentation don't adequately compensate for the banality of the content .",0.57

"" cobb goes to pains to dispel this simplistic view . image has little to do with reality . tremendous statistics do not make for a tremendous person . when our heroes turn out to be less like dale murphy and more like ty cobb , we feel betrayed and slighted . on those occasions , we have only ourselves to blame because in our society , it's the . 367 lifetime batting average that earns the reverence , regardless of how despicable the man holding the bat is .",0.77

"take a typical romantic comedy , add a dash of cameron crow's singles , and top it off with a little when harry met sally , and you get reality bites , ben stiller's feature film debut , and the movie that draws out the most memorable performance from winona ryder since heathers ( the age of innocence not excepted ) . it's life without a direction , however . reality bites starts with a lot of promise , but it doesn't take long for its freshness to wear thin . struggling for the feel of singles , the film matches neither the quirkiness nor the honest insight of the 1992 feature . it doesn't take long for the central romantic conflict to become established , and from then to the conclusion , reality bites follows a number of standard formulas . the characters are all types , with little or no depth beyond the expected . this is true not only of the central figures , but the supporting ones as well . it becomes tiresome after a while to continually make accurate predictions of what each character is going to do . commercialism runs rampant , as well . some of the product placements are grossly obvious ( so obvious that i'm willing to give director ben stiller the benefit of the doubt and wonder if he isn't satirizing their use in other movies ) , and the soundtrack has all the marks of something designed to sell cds and tapes . at least when troy is required to sing , it's actually ethan hawke dubbing the vocals . there are some clever moments , the best of which are the satires of mtv- type "" cutting edge "" programming . winona ryder turns in a strong performance as lelaina , but she is often upstaged by janeane garofalo , who has all the best one-liners . would that the chemistry between ms . ryder and her male co-stars was as strong . this makes it difficult to care about the central romance . also , from the beginning , there's never really any doubt about who lelaina is going to end up with . frankly , i expected more from reality bites . it's certainly a watchable film , but it lacks any semblance of originality . beneath a thin veneer of style , all the old cliches and formulas of typical romantic comedies lie buried . a number of people , especially fans of ms . ryder , will be delighted by this film , but i can't add my voice to their acclaim . reality bites is far too ordinary .",0.55

"obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become "" colored "" and those who remain in "" black-and-white , "" and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day "" alice in wonderland "" look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this "" cute "" idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly "" hip "" new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s "" feel good "" type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up .",0.3

"leo tolstoy's anna karenina , bernard rose's ( immortal beloved ) attempt to bring the great russian novel to the screen , is , in its own way , as flawed and unsuccessful as its illustrious predecessors . as an unabashed fan of the novel , i have never been impressed by hollywood's tepid attempts to film it . even with luminaries like greta garbo and vivien leigh in the title role , the stripped-down story has barely resembled its inspiration , looking instead like an overplotted , costume melodrama . anna karenina is not unfilmable ( a 10-part bbc mini-series made during the '70s was quite good ) , but , given the time constraints of a theatrical feature , it's next-to-impossible to make an effective adaptation . rose's brave-but-disappointing attempt reinforces this belief . the storyline for anna karenina is widely-known , so i won't spend much time recapping it here . rose's boldest stroke in this version is to leave in the kitty/levin subplot , rather than excising it ( which is what happens in most adaptations ) . while retaining levin's story provides the overall tale with greater balance and depth , it eats up valuable time and dilutes the focus . what works in the book doesn't necessarily succeed on screen , and the result is a choppy and uneven motion picture . character development is almost nonexistent as time pressure forces rose to push on without giving the audience an opportunity to digest what's happening or get into the protagonists' heads . there are times when anna karenina seems not like a filmed version of the cliffnotes , but of the abridged cliffnotes . i have several casting quibbles , as well . french actress sophie marceau ( braveheart ) is a cool , regal beauty -- not the right type at all to play the hot-blooded , passionate anna . marceau is a good actress , but she's wrong for this role , and her icy rendering of anna leaves viewers largely unconcerned about the fate of the character . kirshner's north american accent is out- of-place , and molina never properly captures levin's deep-rooted melancholy . despite the problems with story , characterization , and acting , anna karenina is far from a complete bust . visually , it's nothing less than stunning ( with outside locations filmed in russia ) -- the most eye- catching motion picture since kenneth branagh's hamlet . ballroom interiors , landscapes , and even close-ups of faces leave the viewer entranced . at one point during the movie , when karenin remarks , "" there's so much splendor here . one's eyes are bedazzled , "" he might have been talking about the look of the film . the soundtrack , which features the work of tchaikovsky , rachmaninoff , and prokofiev , is equally arresting . had the script for anna karenina matched the production values , this movie would have been a rousing success , but that's not the case . once , near the very end , as a broken vronsky reflects on what has transpired , the movie finally allows us to feel for a character , but , as the saying goes , it's too little , too late . leo tolstoy's anna karenina has its good points , but there's nothing here to warrant such an extravagant remake . for anyone who really wants to enjoy the story , with its rich characters , stimulating ideas , and wrenching tragedy , a copy of the paperback book should cost about as much as a movie ticket , and will provide a more lasting and worthwhile investment .",0.55

"" her solution is a 24-hour cable show featuring a single man , sort of a real-time version of the pbs series about the lou family from the1970s . ed's debut is anything but auspicious . when a sleepy ed finally gets up enough energy to fix himself some pop tarts , whitaker sarcastically calls it an action sequence . filled with incredibly boring minutia -- ed's lack of skill as a toe nail clipper , for example -- the show looks like it may not last the week , if that far .

"" it's its own virtue . "" the mystery in the story is whether ed will ever be able to quit , and , if so , how ? an even bigger one is whether the writers will be able to do it in a way that audiences feel satisfying . suffice it to say that the ending undoubtedly passed all of the test screenings with flying colors . with ron howard as the director , you can be sure that you'll leave with a satisfied smile on your face . so then we have that one final question . how does this movie differ from the truman show ? edtv never tries to be anything more than a diverting little comedy . the truman show aimed much higher and succeeded . it was funny and insightful with very serious themes whereas edtv just wants to entertain you . both achieve their goals . it is rated pg-13 for mature themes and some profanity and would be fine for kids around 11 and up .",0.7
"the problem with movies like rush hour 2 that give away almost all of the good jokes in the trailers is that seeing the movie itself is about as much fun as watching reruns . in rush hour 2 , this problem is further compounded by the lack of freshness in the jokes themselves . the movie's almost saving grace is that it stars that teddy bear of a martial arts comedic hero , jackie chan . and women , if you do have a thing for jackie , you'll be glad to know that you'll get a chance to catch a glimpse of his naked buttocks this time . blink , and you'll miss it . they have good chemistry together even if tucker keeps trying to upstage chan . but , if you've seen the trailers , you already know the joke . the setup this time , to the extent that one is needed in a chan movie , concerns the thwarting of an international counterfeiting ring . don cheadle has a cameo that works best in the outtakes , just about always the best part of any chan film anyway . as always , chan is lovable , funny and vulnerable . unlike most action heroes , his pain is palpable . working from an unimaginative script by ross lamanna , director brett ratner is never able to get the pacing right , with long slack sections slowing the momentum between funny moments . in the movies today , all roads lead to las vegas , where the neon glitters and all of the buildings are little more than movie sets for adults . rush hour 2 ends there in a burst of glory that hints at what could have been if the rest of the movie were better written and more tightly paced . it is rated pg-13 for action violence , language and some sexual material and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . they both thought that it was funny and had well planned out laughs . in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",0.6
"mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 102 minutes . somehow , there's something even more icky about an exploitative and routine horror film that tarts up its exploitation and routineness with plenty of style . such is the case with neil jordan's in dreams , a psychological thriller which lets its atmospheric creepiness disintegrate into a trite chase-n-terrorize puree . for a while , it looks like in dreams is going to be a thriller of a different stripe , something as dramatically and visually compelling as it is viscerally shocking . the story takes claire on a descent into genuine madness , the kind that makes a character truly unpredictable and interesting to watch . partly it seems rushed , with scenes slammed together too quickly to develop the necessary foreboding . and partly it seems mean-spirited , using graphic murders for shock value or imperiled children for sympathy value , rather than building interest in the characters . over its final 45 minutes , in dreams begins a slow but steady descent from potent psychological thriller to careless mess . to be fair to downey , the role is a serial killer cliche -- he's a norman bates momma's boy with _serious_ gender role issues -- without a remotely sympathetic quality , dashing hopes of a mind-game showdown into the rocks . instead it's all guns and sharp objects , running and screaming , until a bleak , unsatisfying and confounding resolution . it's a huge disappointment coming from neil jordan , a film-maker who has consistently made films that defied expectations -- the company of wolves , the crying game , the butcher boy . in a sad way , that's exactly what he does here . just when you expect in dreams might turn out to be a memorably disturbing horror film , it turns out to be a gutless , nihilistic tease . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .",0.4
"this powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not , as most hollywood films are , made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be . labute's debut film is hard to describe , though the plot is simple enough , but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood . that what comes out of these conversations , to say the least , is disdainful , but that is not the point labute is trying to make , nor does he use these talks solely for shock value . what is taking place is more real than that , and much more frightening . playwright labute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to one's fragile ego . the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way , as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have , and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance . but the point of the story is , that their life is absurd , so why not get what you want , no matter what you have to do to get it ) . at least , we have the feeling that aaron understands this . the movie is not driven by plot , so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore ( though not for the world of plays , from where the director draws his strength ( ala mamet ) , which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate ) . what is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral , is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect . i must respectfully say , this film has balls . no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be , it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level . i think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability , and wonder about how that other person now feels , the one who did harm to us , how is he or she getting on . this film does that to us ; it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives . we realize that aaron wins because he is a charmer , but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm . but we are not really comfortable with aaron's aggressiveness , and out first reaction , is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen . but i wonder how many aaron-types we have met in real-life and didn't recoil from . and his lies , are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell ; while , the matts' of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didn't quite like but didn't know why , as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance , but you know instinctively that you can't trust them , that they will harm you if they can , that they just can't help being the worms they are . stacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for . the three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film . stacy's role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off , because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability , and being "" the female "" in the film . this is not a flawless picture , but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one's more tender feminine side . it is able to captivate us , because its words have power .",0.7
"nothing like low expectations to enhance your movie-going pleasure . invited to a special theatrical screening of bharat nalluri's the crow : salvation , recently released on tape and dvd , i wasn't particularly looking forward to it . although i wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it , the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing , albeit overly dramatic , acting . the script is so over the top that it would probably work better for an animated movie than a live-action production . think of the film as a cross between dark city and a charles bronson revenge thriller . shot impressively by carolyn chen , the movie has a striking look of dark blues shrouded in fog . the red of the ever-present blood serves as the main contrast to the film's bluish tint . if you rent the movie and you find the story a bit too ludicrous , you can always enjoy the visuals . it is rated r for pervasive strong violence and for sexual content and language . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .",0.6
"it doesn't take long , however , for astonishment to turn to horror . nevertheless , the enjoyment of any movie is hardly predicated by a factual premise . the apparent realism of some of crichton's pseudo-science imbues jurassic park with a grounding that is acceptable in our high-tech world . the science may not be real , but it must sound good enough to allow a suspension of disbelief . in that , this film ( and the book that spawned it ) succeeds . of course , the special effects help immensely . they are so good , in fact , and the dinosaurs look so real , that i half expected to see "" dinosaur trainer "" during the closing credits . instead , however , honor should be heaped upon the creators of jurassic park's primary screen presences ( all apologies to the actors ) . all-in-all , the wizards at ilm have done an outstanding job , giving us by far the most impressive and believable monster movie of all time . nothing compares . would that the story is the equal of its execution . to begin with , crichton's book , while filled with fascinating ideas and entertaining moments , hardly holds together as a top-of-the-line adventure story . the ending is especially problematic , resulting in a forty-page denouement that drags slowly to an anticlimactic conclusion . despite numerous small changes and omissions , the movie jurassic park is very much faithful to its printed inspiration . perhaps michael crichton's involvement in the screenplay has something to do with this . the biggest weakness of the novel is characterization , and the same flaw is fully evident in the screen adaptation . there are a few exceptions . this is as much a tribute to the acting of sam neill and laura dern as to the writing . here , we get a sense of what's going on inside the old man's head . in the book , he's a mixed-up fanatic , but in the film , he's made into a sympathetic , albeit eccentric , figure . interestingly , some transposition has gone on between hammond's two grandchildren . also , here it's alexis , not tim , who's the computer whiz . the plot is little more than a cleverly jumbled-together batch of formulas . as i mentioned before , jurassic park is , reduced to its most basic level , a monster movie . thrown in for good measure is the human interest story--the growing relationship between self-confessed child-hater grant and his two youthful charges--but this part of the film worked least successfully for me . also , there isn't an effective ending . too much is left dangling , demanding that the lion's share of the resolution be confined to the imagination , but at least the movie avoids the book's plodding conclusion . nevertheless , i doubt that there are many who will go to jurassic park for its characters or story . rightly so , crowds will flock to the theaters screening this movie so they can ooh and aah , jump in their seats , and root for the overmatched humans against the big , bad dinosaurs . when it comes to adventure , jurassic park is a roller-coaster ride . with thrills and action in the tradition of , but not up to the level of , aliens and raiders of the lost ark ( another spielberg picture ) , this is an exciting and energetic film with a number of shocks but few letdowns . in the end , jurassic park succeeds because it's good entertainment--a fun night at the movies . unlike something of the ilk of cliffhanger , which also boasts a lot of action , there's some intelligence behind this picture . jurassic park isn't great art , nor is it classic cinema , but at least we don't feel like the producers and director are more interested in getting as much firepower and death on-screen as they can without giving a thought as to whether anyone in the audience has a brain . not having seen all of the summer's offerings ( the last action hero is still a week away ) , i can't say how jurassic park will rate overall , but i will admit that , in my opinion , this is the first big-budget film in a long time to live up to its pre-release reputation . sure , the movie isn't perfect , but it delivers--perhaps more than delivers--what the average viewer will expect from it . summer has long been known as the season for action/adventure films , and jurassic park falls firmly into that category . because of the nature and scope of this movie , i would encourage anyone with more than a passing interest to catch jurassic park in a movie theater . it will lose a lot on the smaller tv screen . without the grandeur of a stereophonic sound system and sizeable picture , much of this film's impact will dwindle away . the dinosaurs will still look real , but there will undoubtedly be some who , upon viewing jurassic park on video , will wonder what all the fuss is about . to this praise , let me add a final word of caution . while the violence in this film is not particularly graphic , it is apparent . people aren't shown getting gored or ripped apart , but the movie makes it perfectly clear what is happening . there are certainly a number of scary and potentially-disturbing moments which , while they add to the spice for older viewers , may be inappropriate for younger ones .",0.7
"a very good sequel to "" the invisible man ( 33 ) , "" though not as imaginative as the original . the search for the killer was too obvious to be interesting , but the fun to be had was when the side effects to the serum kicked in and geoffrey became egomaniacal . the film received a nomination for a special effects oscar in 1941 .",0.6
"dirty ballet dancing , released under the pseudonym of center stage , tries to make the hard and competitive world of ballet dancing as much fun as rock and roll . not since jennifer grey and patrick swayze cut a rug in the catskills has a movie so wanted to demonstrate the sensuous joy of moving one's body to a beat . although center stage doesn't really find its groove until the last act , its dance numbers are well worth the price of admission . just try to forgive the amount of celluloid director nicholas hytner ( the object of my affection and the crucible ) wastes on the story's hackneyed romances . screenwriter carol heikkinen subscribes to the "" one of "" theory of script design , so the dozens of dancers include : one gay , one bulimic , one not skinny , one loud mouth , one black male and one hispanic female . the rest are so interchangeable that you'll wish that they had numbers on them to make it easier to tell them apart . and since the writer doesn't want to make a choice , she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories , all at the expense of the dance sequences , which is the only reason to see the movie in the first place . one of the film's most instructive and fascinating segments has the ballet dancers using everything from fire to water in order to get their toe shoes into just the right shape . the dancers endure incredible pain for the slim chance that they'll hit the big time , and the chorus -- in which you can tell your friends that you're the third one from the left -- is the most that even the better students can realistically hope for . speaking almost in whispers , the instructors give their generally mild critiques . light-years away from the drill instructor style that one would expect , they are so quiet that it's a miracle that the dancers can hear them . but the story's limitations become mere quibbles when the dancing starts . the best of the dancers , ethan stiefel as cooper nielsen , amazes us with his high flying , twirling bravado . when he engages another in a dazzling dancing duel , there's never any question as to who will emerge as the winner . although not his equal in technical skill , amanda schull as jody sawyer , plays the dancer with the most heart . when they perform the long ending sequence together , the movie sizzles , and the choreography wows us with its inviting originality . see it first on the big screen , and later , when it goes to video , hit the fast-forward button every time the dancing stops . it is rated pg-13 for language and some sensuality and would be fine for kids around 11 or 12 and up .",0.6
