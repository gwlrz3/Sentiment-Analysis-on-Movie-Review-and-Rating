    "The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.\n",

    "Hence we will use Word Embeddings, a technique where words are encoded as real-valued vectors in a high dimensional space, where the similarity between words in terms of meaning translates to closeness in the vector space. This reduces sparsity of the data, as well as gives more meaning to each word in this embedded space, rather than just present or not. For more information on word embeddings, check out my experiments with Word Embeddings on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones [here](https://github.com/darshanbagul/Word_Embeddings)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we won't have to use Gensim or create an embedding network from scratch. This is another advantage of using Keras. We just include another layer after the input in our model for generating embeddings of the input word! Keras provides a convenient way to convert positive integer representations of words into a word embedding by an **Embedding layer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will map each word onto a **32 length real valued vector**. We will also limit the total number of words that we are interested in modeling to the **5000 most frequent words, and zero out the rest.** Finally, the sequence length (number of words) in each review varies, so we will **constrain each review to be 500 words,** truncating long reviews and pad the shorter reviews with zero values. (Another alternative for this could be experimenting with a Dynamic RNN, but that is something I shall experiment with later.)"
